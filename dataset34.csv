A2FIC05DY3HT7J,B000ETXX1U,Philster Philster,"[1, 1]",Ive purchased several air mattresses in the past twenty years  Most of them Ive used a few times and they fail to hold any air after a few uses  These are air mattresses Ive payed anwhere from 30  60 for  When I needed a new air mattress when we were moving I decided it was time to buy an air mattress that would lastI purchased this air mattress in July 2008 from Amazon  As a Prime member the mattress arrived at my new house the day I arrived giving me a mattress to sleep on that evening  The mattress aired up then as it does now in under five minutes and deflates by its own pumps in about the same time making for easy storage in its own bagNow the number one issue Ive always had with air mattresses is leaking air  This mattress has had at least a few months of use off and on in the past three years  Ive never had an issue with air loss although it seems it is better to add more air to the outside chamber after the inside chamber has been aired completely  The second issue with air mattresses is comfort  This is by far the most comfortable air mattress Ive ever slept on  In fact Id sleep on this every night if I could  I have back issues and this mattress is far more comfortable on my back than my conventional mattressIm writing this review today because I have this mattress aired up in our guest room from a month ago  I have a desk in that room and have even thrown a few books and files on the mattress over a few weeks  Out of curiosity I decided to see if the mattress was still firm and to my surprise I could not believe it didnt need air added to it  I would recommend this air mattress to anyone who needs an air mattress and wants to be able to use the air mattress more than once or twice in addition to comfort  It may be about twice as much money as a smaller mattress but the knee height is much easier when sleeping on it and the comfort is many time better  Ive estimated that the cheaper mattresses have cost me several times more money per nights use compared to this one as they lasted for such a short timeUPDATE 92113I have started using this mattress a few days a week for the past several months  My guess is that this mattress has been used by my estimate at least 100 nights maybe closer to 150 nights and it still holds air well  Recently Ive had the mattress inflated for over two months and have not had to add air once  In the past I have purchased half a dozen air mattresses and all of them combined have not lasted as long as this one has  I would highly recommend this air mattress to anyone looking for an air mattress that they wish to use for more than a few nights,5.0,Worth the money,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",5

AR0QOXIQ7ZOKY,B001DMJPLO,C Macaluso,"[7, 8]",After a solid week of research I decided on a platform style hitch rack for my bikes However I also required compatibility with a Class 1 receiver which limits the amount of options I have with these styles of racks I was between a few brands but what sealed the deal for me was the ratcheting frame hooks Most racks in this price range look and function similarly but few have the ratcheting hooks and instead opt for a more complicated screw tension model This model also has updated rubber wheel straps as opposed to velcro straps like most other racks out there Both of these were selling points for me Another thing to mention is that this rack actually has an S shape to the receiver insert so it lifts the platform out of the way of low lying car exhaust pipesPackaging was pretty crappy with absolutely no padding to protect the rack but it did arrive undamaged The box was mangled though The ratcheting frame hooks dont really have much in terms of padding but instead have a harder rubber which does protect it from scratching or marring frames I further padded this rack with a bit of pipe insulation found at the hardware storeMy one unpleasant surprise with this rack was upon unboxing finding a warranty paper that stated that the rack came with a 1 year limited warranty I had done research on Swagman before this purchase and could have sworn I had read that all of their racks came with a limited lifetime warranty 1 year vs lifetime was a huge difference I was prepared to return it for that reason alone regardless of how it performed but after a quick email to Swagman it was confirmed that all Swagman racks do come with a limited lifetime warranty valid for the original purchaser I was relieved to hear thatOne other thing to note after a little reading of the manual the manual makes mention of avoiding use on cars with stiff suspensionsprings Unfortunately this rack will be also used on a sports car from time to time so I am going to pay special attention to it during that type of use but at a glance the rack seems way too sturdy to ever have a problem from shaking or jarringI would recommend this rackEdit One last thing to note The SUV that I will be using this on 2006 Honda CRV has a spare tire which extends off the back of the vehicle unfortunately this rack does not extend far enough out of the receiver to clear that spare tire and allow 2 bikes to be attached Without any sort of receiver extension I am limited to carrying one bike on the rack With a 7 extension I should be able to carry two bikes but would still not be able to fold the rack up into the stowed position,4.0,Rack is great for the price Warranty unspecified but I have the answer you are looking for,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",5

A1PDQB47USGSJE,B0043B51EC,RickJP,"[5, 5]",I recently started road cycling and 50 of my rides are at night  I quickly found out I needed a much brighter light than the Bell iPulse torch I had bought which in and of itself is quite a strong little light  But it simply was not enough to totally satisfy my sense of see and be seen  So with the acquisition of my new road bike I figured a new light was in order and was looking at this one the Niterider Minewt 250 and the Serfas TSL250  While I already own a Serfas USLTL60 rear light I bought at my LBS I didnt get the TSL250 because I thought the 13000 price tag was a bit too steep  Im glad I saw this oneJust went last out night on a 14 mile out and back on a road with varying illumination my first night ride after acquiring this light and I was blissfully impressed by it  Tried all light settings except for flashing mode I attached my iPulse torch to my helmet using the strap that came with this light but not the mount so I used that one in flashing mode and found the light to have excellent brightness especially in dark stretches of road where there is very little vehicle traffic and you really need to see whats out there  The convenience of switching from low to med and to high depending on the amount of street lighting available is well priceless  Unfortunately many bike lanes near my home tend to be a bit cluttered with debris and other hazards that are hard to see without proper illunination so having this light was the proverbial breath of fresh airOne nice thing I found about this light is that the handle bar assembly allows the light to pivot about 10  15 degrees left and right of center so you can pan the light for better illumination of the road ahead  I dont know if it works the same using the helmet mount and I dont intend to find out as Ill only use it on my handlebarsOnly two things I wish it had are 1 a cutout like the iPulse torch at each side so the light could be visible from the side then again thats another reason why I attached the iPulse torch to my helmet and 2 good rubber pads for use on 318mm handlebars  I have a spare innertube from an old MTB I owned from which I cut small strips for the purpose of tying my back up dive light to the harness of my buoyancy compensator so I cut a 12 inch wide strip and used it as a bumper pad for my handlebars to avoid the light scratching it  It worked like a charmIm going to do a 20 mile out and back this week weather permitting on a stretch of road with only patches of lighting and sporadic traffic and will report back afterwardsBut for now all in all Im extremely satisfied with the Cygolite Expilion 250 and will highly recommend it  UPDATE 83011 Decided to take a quick peak at Cygolites website as I didnt get an owners manual with my light  Found out that the Cygolite Expilion 250 will last UP TO TEN 10 HOURS on low steady mode  I called Cygolite and confirmed that it can last up to TEN 10 HOURS not six 6 as it states hereSee for yourself   UPDATE 9711 Have not been able to do that 20 mile night ride yet but had a chance on an early ride this morning to test the light again on a stretch of road where all the street lights were out  When you ride near what used to be swamp land just 15 years ago youre likely to see some wild life roaming the streets here and there and I was glad to have this light and see that 4 foot gator with enough time to swerve out of its way  Also on an early ride the day before yesterday a lady powerwalking on the sidewalk in opposite direction to where I was traveling had to cover her eyes to deal with the brightness of this light  I helped her by panning the light to the left and she yelled Thank you,5.0,Best bang for the buck,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",5

A2BAWLYA43PJYN,B004LJ8N78,Mr Staack,"[5, 5]",Im a longtime Virgin Mobile customer and have always elected to own very spartan phones  My work and social life didnt require anything fancier and the simpler phones generally held up better than my colleagues smart phones  However after expanding my business its become necessary to own an Android smartphone that enables me to conduct my everyday duties  As well it would be nice to own a fun handsetI did a lot of research comparing cellular carriers in my area particularly the Chicagoland suburbs and it turned out Virgin Mobile  with the LG Optimus V smartphone  was just perfect for me  Virgin Mobile using Sprints network as its backbone has always provided great coverage in and around the cities and states I work in  For service I signed up for the 25month service  300 anytime talk minutes and unlimited data and text suits me just fine  Ive never gotten close to my limit  Virgin Mobile throttles 3G data after a 2GB cap but Ive never gotten close to that I rely on encrypted wifi in most of my offices  As a Virgin Mobile customer for years and Ive always been pleased with their cellular service and their customer service  Im paying less than most of my friends however I feel I get comparable service  sometimes even better service especially the poor souls with ATT who cant get a dependable signal in the Chicago Loop area  The 3G download and upload speeds are comparable to other 3G service in my area  I average 2000 kbs at home and get even faster speeds in downtown Chicago  An added bonus with Virgin Mobiles nocontract service is that Im not locked into some draconian service plan  NiceMy roommate and several of my pals have the TMobile G2X aka the Optimus 2X and the Optimus V compares quite favorably  While the moreexpensive G2X has a nicer camera LED flash bulb a slightly nicer screen more internal memory and a faster CPU  Truthfully I think the Optimus V is only just slightly less awesome than the G2X  And in the areas where the Optimus V are weaker they really dont faze me  I dont need a powerhouse phone  but even when Im playing games or editing photos I feel like the Qualcomm 600 MHz CPU holds up just fine  Its still the most powerful phone Ive owned and is no slouch against other samegeneration smartphones Ive usedThe Optimus V and very open Android Froyo 221 OS really does suit my needs quite perfectly  I can run the latest builds of Opera Mobile TeamViewer remote control software Square with the little credit card reader Hulu Plus Netflix movies Avast Antivirus MyBackup Pro Facebook Cerberus tracking software PDF and ebook reader Springpad RadioReference Scanner Radio Groundspeak geocaching app MortPlayer multiformat music player Zedge multiformat QQPlayer for videos WiGLE war driving and many other apps  including the occasional game and augmented reality apps  Additional perks are Google Suite integration Gmail Google Contact Google Calendar YouTube videos Google Maps and Google GPS Navigation  The Android operating systems makes it supereasy to customize  Custom wallpapers ringtones alarm clocks animated screen savers advanced launchers custom security lockout screens and more are available online  There really isnt any part of this phone I cant customize to my liking WITHOUT having to root it which I hear is fairly easyIts a fine form factor  1135 mm 447 in tall 59 mm 23 in wide and 133 mm 052 in thick  With the stock 1500 mAh battery it weighs a comfortable 129 g 46 oz  The battery life is a little better than the G2X under similar usage and there are highercapacity batteries available  As well there are a ton of accessories available for the Optimus V  With a little shopping around I found numerous cases screen protection charges data cables  all for super cheap  I added in a 32GB micro SDHC card and it instantly recognized it  Connected to my computer via USB micro cable it was instantly recognized and mounted on Windows XP Vista and Win7  After months of daily usage after loading a myriad of apps I havent had any major crashes  The touchscreen is very precise and sensitive allowing for complex actions and quick typing Ive since started using Swype  The speakers and mic are pretty good with no complaints about call quality  The voice recognition works really well either with the built in microphone or using a headset  The external jack works fine though I only use it for the Square card reader  For hands free I use a Bluetooth headset  all of which I was able to easily pair up  All of the buttons are sturdy and offer a satisfying click when pressed  After months of use the buttons still feel good as new  The camera isnt too shabby in adequate light either with automatic geotagging  Video recording is also quite good for a phone  A feature that comes in real handy is that you can use the phone as a mobile hotspot with the use of a free app  This really is a welldesigned handset and never seems to freeze or crash after months of extensive useAm I the envy of owners of Apple iHype products or stateoftheart Android handsets  Doubt it  Virgin Mobile may not be the sexiest of service providers and the LG Optimus V isnt the most vogue handset  Do I care  Heck no  Honestly Im PROUD to own a phone that is reasonably powerful stable energy efficient and bargain priced  I feel the Virgin Mobile Optimus V is the killer bargain of its generation and will serve most folks quite well  without costing them a fortune,5.0,Great Smartphone No Contract Low Price,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",5

A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B004KOXDWE,Chandler,"[12, 14]",Edited to add TRX only comes with one DVD and you have to pay extra for the door mount with that systemIll start by saying this is the most fun Ive ever had working outAnd that you dont have to have a door to attach it to nor a treeif you have a ceilingwhich I hope you doyou can buy the celing mount Buy or borrow a stud finder and when it beeps there is your wood beam Dont have ceilings EESHbut no worryif you have walls you can use it to Use the stud finder to find the wood beam in your wall and attach the ceilingwall mount to thatOkay now on with my reviewI have had my eye on this system for a good year now  I began comparing systems the first time I heard about suspension training in a fitness magazine  This was originally developed to train Navy Seals and now is used in gyms to train pro football players and in homes Suspension training morphs your muscles more quickly than even P90x in tests because you are using so many at one time in any move you do including engaging your core constantly  So in the time it would take you to do one move in any other system you are working several at a time By using your own body weight in a fun almost gymnaststyle approach Without the talent or training needed for gymnasticsI have talked myself out of buying this for two reasons for the last yearWhen you open the door to my workout room you dont walk into the front or back of the room but one corner of the side with my tv to the rightnot a place it would work In my art studio the door is also to the the right of the wall No room except for on one sideThen I read about the ceiling mount  I had to convince myself that was a good idea Because I had to get out the drillSecondly I have loads of workout equipment and logistically the need for one more toy that was a couple hundred bucks was nothing I ever talked myself into and the contest I entered to win one resulted in nothingStill in the last year I continually eyed suspension training products and watched it only became more popular with raving fansThen Santa Claus knocked the cost down about 50 from what it wasSOLDSo with a year to salivate over the various systems why did I buy this one  Its always listed as the better made one as far as the straps go on the suspension training forums by those who have tried other ones Additionally the other systems didnt have the better design of the straps that this didin that it allows you to do more movements due to the way they are made to allow for versatility where the others are stable back and forth motions I originally wanted the TRX when it first came out and this was not yet out but it was always twice the price once this was introduced didnt have the mobility ability in the strap design as this did and didnt come with the DVD library and since I wasnt one whod been taking classes with this I didnt have 8 training routines memorized on my ownI wanted that optionbut more importantly I liked the descriptions I read in the comparison of the straps I looked at other systems as well and they didnt come with the workouts or the better design of the straps as this did I dont feel this is hardly marketed at all so its possible one is paying for marketing in the other ones I would never have known about it had I not seen it on the Amazon Vine catalog about a year ago and I missed out on that oneThat said I bought a TRX ceiling mount because I actually didnt know Rip60 made one again poor marketing in my opinion Its not even mentioned on this page until I got my system and it was shown on an inside cardIm glad I got the mount You can mount it to a wall or celing and are no longer limited with working around your door You just get a stud finder and find a stud in your wall or ceiling and use the screws to screw it in I borrowed a stud finder from my neighbor screwed it in and was good to go I read that this wall mount the rip60 brand did not come with the screws which is silly to meyou need some really long and heavyduty ones and I dont trust myself to pick them out on my own nor do I want to have to do that so Im actually glad I bought the TRX ceiling mount with my Rip 60 suspension trainerThis guarantees youll see a more ripped body in 60 days Im not at 60 days yet so Ill keep you posted Am I seeing results Yes Am I feeling results OH YEAHThat said this is different than any other tool youll use and is easy to travel with if you use the door system during travelI can unclip my system from my ceiling mount in a second so I can take in anywhere and it has a chart to help you remember your moves away from the DVDbut a huge reason I chose this was that it came with so many training and motivational DVDsthis keeps me moving pumps me up shows me how to do the moves right gives me a system to do it in like a personal trainer is at my side but better yetit has one DVD per week for the first 8 weeks plus 4 bonus DVDsthere is no guessing game or stopping to read a chart You keep moving have cardio to make you lose FAT and not just gain muscle on top of fat and they are easy to follow along I am not coordinated by any meansWhen you are working your legs you are working your arms and core you can use with other equipment like kettle bells and I use this with all my other workout DVDsfor example I do the core work or push ups with my legs up for twice the workout even if the instructor on a cardio DVD is limited to her floorI can do a plank off the floor nowmy feet are on the floor and my arms are beneath me in the straps Thats more fun and most moves this way are far more gentle on your knees as wellI have always despised squats I dont think I have great balance Hated lunges Now they arent only fun but I work a huge amount of muscles rather than just my legs and rear doing them  When I lunge I have my arms in the suspension trainer and balance that way and lift myself up from my arms This is not only fun but it also works my ABS while Im doing it as well as my arms by pulling myself up after the lunge or squat which works my legs and rear It just engages tons of muscles at one timeBetter yet it hits those hard to reach muscles under your arms constantly so your bat wings fly awayThis reminds me of when I went skiiing for the first timeIm working muscles I never have beforeYou will also feel your chest muscles improve due to the lifts with your arms This gives men great pecs and women a noninvasive free liftNegatives The directions of putting it together werent that simple to me Its only a 3 piece system but I think they assume you have used one before so you know where everything goes I hadnt  That said comparing the straps to the pictures made it easy after I understood what was supposed to happen where  It did not for example tell me on the paper that came with it how far the straps should be from the floor when hung from the ceiling mountThe DVD shows how to adjust the straps but also says practically nothing I simply had to study how theirs looked on the workout DVD to realize I could have some leftover strap and loop it It said NOTHING anywhere about mounting it from a ceiling or wall Mainly I thought they geared the instructions of installation for those who use it on a door and ignored those of us who had a ceiling mount They showed pictures of it on a door and over a tree branch but I just had to compare the tree branch to the mount to get what they wanted me to do there or what direction it should go in I found it didnt really matter much how I had it attached to the ceiling mount but that took me hours to know I couldnt really screw it up by trying various methodsNontheless I had it mounted and was using it in 15 minutes once I got done looking at pictures and figuring what went where and by the looks of things already just a couple weeks in this is not only fun but a major body changer in less time than anything Ive used priorIt was worth the waitNOTE Nowhere in the instructions or DVD instructions does it properly tell you about the straps in one regard And by reading other reviews I see that my initial confusion is universal If you take the velcro to the top you may think this is as short as the strap will go This is actually a bad idea as the velcro will hit as you make a sawing motion I studied the straps on the DVD and realized they do not tighten the STRAPS to the top just the buckle which means you have loops beside the straps where the excess strap is This wont make sense to those who dont own the system but for those who dojust look at how they have the straps on the DVD This means regardless of wall height you can easily adjust it to whatever you need As long as the ceiling is higher than you you are good I thought I was limited due to the preformed straps but because the BUCKLE position is what matters not the velcro part above it which can be just above the buckle with all excess strap hanging beside the buckle see DVD I realized I could better do all I needed as far as strap adjustmentAlso if you have ever used a seatbelt buckle on an airplane youll know how easy this is to adjustits the same thing Pull up the buckle pull the strap release the buckle Done No effort at all and holds solid,5.0,I compared various systems and nothing else came close this is a rapidfire body morphing system,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",5

LockingResetting ScopeI needed this Barska Mount for the scope on the rifles 11mm Dove Tail punched rails to fit the new UTG scopeBarska Dovetail  Weaver Converter Rifle Scope MountTogether they form a dominant scope and mount system what with the quickrelease but strong as a Bull Run horse in the wild scope rings with 4HD hex screws per ring for scope retention the Barska Dove Tail to WeaverPicatinny rail mount scope adapter has 4 four really LARGE securing Hex nuts for the most possible scope retentionno movement system I could find I have shot more than 500 rounds of lead and alloy pellets through the new rifle during its first week here at my place mostly targeting my two shooting traps and tearing the Hell out of both of them in the process with 10001250FPS firepower from the Benjamin NP power system and there has been ZERO movement from any part of the scope or its mounts it is ROCK SOLID and isnt going to be moving at all unless I purposefully take it down for some reasonI secured those 4 large Hex screws per ring with Blue No 24200 Loctite one drop per Hex screw let it set up for about 3 mins before I inserted each screw one by one into their respective placements with about  35foot pounds of force diagonally torqing each one down diagonally to opposite diagonal hex screw until finished and BAM SAM Without having to put too much pressure on the beautiful alloy tube that houses all the optics and electronics for that amazing MilDot RedGreen illuminated reticle scope I avoided having to worry about the screws having a tendency loosening get turning and destroy my scope sighting and secure shooting mounting that I arrived at after approximately 100 shots and single trips to my targets over and over again at 25M 50M and then 100M out from the shooting area in the back of our property I pronounce my setup 100 solid and these scope rings are amazing to work with in terms of sighting in a new scope and riflethey are just studs of their breed the bestIf I for instance had occasion to want to remove the rings and scope for servicing whateverId have no worries as to placement for the return remounting of the whole system Id simply mark the front and facing edge of each ring on the Weaver scope mounts with a line of Magic Marker White colorwhich comes off quickly with plain water on a QTip per side of the ring mounts and I could just simply bolt up the scope and rings back to the Weaver mount in the right places as marked and BAM SAM Id be back in bizness without much interruption of shooting ie theres no doubt the quickrelease scope mounts from UTG have many benefitsI can sight down the barrel of the rifle no fixed mechanical sights on the full bull barrel which in itself is such an amazing item with its soundproofing action 6line rifling inside of the composite scope barrel on a flash cintered steel barrel surface through the peep holes in the highmount scope rings and get an idea where to aim the rifle when targeting so thats another convenience built into this high quality ring setLike I wrote it was a big surprise for me to discover the ring mount set inside of my optical scope kit from UTG which arrived in a beautifully finished silver black and grey logod scope box with tons of extra padding and foam pieces to secure the scope in transit from China to UTGs facility then off to Amazons warehouse before finally being shipped to me FedEx 2nd Day Air via my PRIME accountand I mean I was 100 amazed at the look obvious strength and security these ring mounts would provide my new rifle setup It simply stunned me to hold and take apart each section of the scopes ring set by UTG like the scope and see how finely finished they both wereThere wasnt a ding mark kracklefinished paint mistake or cosmetic ding of any kind on both rings they were simply superb in their overall condition and something I would be proud to include in my brand new rifle and rig setup I cannot say enough about the quickrelease bolts that go under and through the mount to secure it 100 on the scope mount All one has to do to secure them fully is give each one a 3040foot pounds of torque twist with a heavyduty hex wrench that was also furnished in the scope kit so Kudos to UTG for designing and furnishing a scope system that was ready to blow bullets fresh out of the box and I mean they left nothing out for details and specialty pieces I also found a huge optical glasscleaning towel about 6 x 9 in size with the UTG logo emblazoned in silver on black cloth a very classy looking lens cloth to say the least that I am faithfully using on the lenses when I am through shooting before I close up the HD rubberplastic composite snapon lens covers that are stock OEM with that particular scope setupUTG Rocks I give this ring scope mount set a solid 5 stars across the board and theres nothing that will convince me otherwise I am certain of that because these things are ROCK SOLID like I wrote above extremely impressive contentwise with the thickness of the rings the mount body itself the special and amazing protective tape inside of the ring mounts themselves to protect my scopes outer surface from scratches etc In short I cannot imagine a better setup for my scope mount than I have right now I tried out the Instapark singlepiece direct Dove Tail to ringmounts setup and I just didnt feel it was going to prove to be heavyduty enough of a mounting system for my 185 ounce scope and its trappings over time so off it came and its back in its OEM box I am waiting a bit to decide if Ill keep it or return it before the 30day deadline is up as I still have a couple weeks to make that decision so Im in no great rush to decide its fate as yetI enclosed a couple photos of the scope mounted on my new Benjamin Nitro Piston woodstocked rifle and it is a thing of beauty I must admit I am not a vain person but my new rifle is just plain treats on toast for my purposes and I doubt if the setup could be improved any at all unless I were to find some setup as substantial and strong as what I have now at a much lighter weight which is going to prove an impossible assignment methinksI recommend this ringmounting setup with its quickrelease attachment bolt armory to the WeaverPicatinny from Dove Tail adapter and scope mount 100 to the good for anyone buying or needing a similar item for their scopes setup Or maybe people are replacing an old ring mount with something new you know These are appropriately labeled Premium Stuff in my book of records and there is no doubt in my mind that UTG put them in the scope kit with xlnt intentions and purpose namely the finest security possible for a new scope on a new rifle so THANKS UTG You are the bestWavey Davey  2192012,5.0,Fantastic

A190EMPCHI6SSH,B00C8YXGB6,Jonathan Brett,"[16, 16]",This review is based on a comparison between the Wagan EL2639 FRED light vs the Smittybilt L1409 UFO light Neither light has yet been field tested or tested against timeI wanted to buy about 6 of this type of light and was leaning toward the Smittybilt based on the slightly higher rating and the fact that it uses a CR123 battery But because of the significant price difference 78 more for the Smittybilt at the time of this writing I decided to buy one of each and compare them myself to see if the price difference was worth it Here are my preliminary observations of the two lightsOuter constructiondesignBoth lights are made very well with a seemingly durable rubberized plastic Orange vs Black molded around a watertight inner housing made of a seemingly durable clear plastic This inner clear plastic appears to be of equal thickness and durability on the two units The outer rubberized plastic is a bit more robust feeling on the Smittybilt because it has 18 outer lugs vs 12 and the lugs are bit larger However this also means that it has smaller LED window areas between each lug In comparison the Wagan has about 916 spacing between lugs vs about 516 on the Smittybilt This becomes very noticeable when viewing the unit from the side with the lights on especially when viewing the Smittybilt in line with one of the 3 triangular points where you see less of the LEDs Note There are no LEDs at these 3 points so although there are 18 lugs there are actually 15 LEDs vs 12 in the Wagan Although the Wagan has fewer LEDs I like having the larger window area for each one as it makes them stand out more from the side Also it is worth considering the color of these units Orange is certainly more visible when the lights are off making it easier to findWinner  WaganSwitchBoth lights use a similar electronic switch in which the button is flush with the housing The Wagan is much easier to push and cycle through The Smittybilt is much more difficult to push however this may not be a bad thing if you are concerned about accidental activation in a pack or something Although I dont foresee the Wagan turning on accidentally since the button is flushWinner  WaganAccess cover constructiondesignBoth lights have a similar removable cover to gain access to the batteries The Wagan is round and its the back cover The Smittybilt is triangular and its the front cover They both require the user to remove 2 screws and gently pry up on the tabs  Wagan has 2 tabs Smittybilt has 3 I had no problems in removing either one and they both had a nice tight fit without being too tight These covers have seals which are what make the unites waterproof The Smittybilt uses a standard Oring design found in many flashlights It is replaceable if you can find one of the same size The Wagan uses a thicker integrated rubber seal that is molded right into the cover It is not replaceable but I doubt it will wear out any time soonWinner  TieInner constructiondesignThe Wagan has a battery compartment  circuit board which is secured to the housing with 2 screws Everything stays in place when changing the batteries Also the switch is on the opposite side of the circuit board so it cannot be disturbed while changing the batteries The Smittybilt also uses a similar circuit board but its just loose in the housing as its held in place only by the 2 screws  posts which hold the access cover on Once inside the entire circuit board is free to come out In fact it will come out when trying to change the battery The battery compartment is very  flimsy as there are no screws holding it to the circuit board It just presses in place around the battery while the battery just sits between two metal contacts on the circuit board It appears cheaply designed with little thought Also the switch on the Smittybilt has a 58 long x 18 diameter plastic extension which goes up through the access cover to the push button It sits right next to the battery compartment which made me feel as though I needed to be very careful when trying to remove the battery And replacing the battery is not real easy compared to the traditional battery compartment found on the Wagan The batteries are MUCH easier to replace on the Wagan This inner construction on the Smittybilt surprised me given the 78 higher priceWinner  WaganModesBoth lights have pretty much the same 9 modes to choose from however the Wagan also has an additional flashlight mode with 3 white LEDS This is a very nice additional mode as it can be very useful when all you need is a small flood light perhaps for reading a book looking at a map or a tent light etcWinner  WaganOperationTo access the modes on both lights you just push the button repeatedly until you get to the mode of your liking Both units turn off by pushing and holding the power button for a few seconds The Smittybilt will turn back on in the last mode in which it was used The Wagan will always turn on in the 3 white LED mode which I much preferredWinner  WaganMagnetsBoth units have equally strong magnets which work great However upon close examination I noticed that the magnet on the Smittybilt appears to be just glued in place whereas the Wagan appears to use a magnet with a 116 step 58 diameter as measured from the outside 1116 diameter as measured from the inside This step should prevent the magnet from ever coming out the back sideWinner  WaganWaterproofbuoyancyI placed both units in a pail of water and neither of them leaked during this short test I pushed both units to the bottom of the pail and let go Both units surfaced floated without any problem but the lighter weight 54 oz vs 69 oz of the Wagan caused it to surface quickerWinner  TieBatteryThe Wagan uses 3 readily available AAA batteries The Smittybilt uses a single CR123 battery It is my opinion that a light of this type ought to have lithium batteries inside to withstand a wider range of temperatures Although you can buy lithium AAA batteries they will cost more than a single CR123 battery This is purely subjective but I prefer using a single CR123 battery Having said that there are more options with the AAA configuration eg heavy duty alkaline lithium If the run times listed on the packages are correct you will get anywhere from a little more 10 hrs vs 9 hrs to a lot more 100 hrs vs 38 hrs run time with the CR123 Smittybilt depending on the mode However these run times may be more evenly matched if using lithium AAA batteries in the WaganWinner  Smittybilt for me but depends on each userAdditional featuresThe Wagan includes a hinged hook which will allow for hanging from a hood latch a tent loop a tree branch etc It only opens 90 degrees Although useful it would have been nice to see it open 180 degrees But given that the Smittybilt doesnt even have this feature its a nice touchWinner  WaganPrice Winner  WaganSummaryI can honestly say that I am not sure why the Smittybilt is sold at a higher price given that they are both made in China and given that I found nothing that leads me to believe its a better product With the exception of having a bit more robust outer rubber plastic it did not excel in any one category In fact my analysis led me to be glad I didnt buy more of these based strictly on review ratings I plan to buy more of the Wagan unitsMy guess is that all the positive reviews for the Smittybilt unit were not based on a comparison of these two units Although a nice product and worthy of a recommendation the Smittybilt is no where near the value of the WaganI dont intend to talk down the Smittybilt or its makers nor would I say that the 4  5 star reviews for it are unreasonable but this is a great example of things being relative By itself I probably would have given the Smittybilt 4 stars But compared to the Wagan I cannot give it more than 3 or 35 stars while I give the Wagan 45 starsMy suggestion to the makers at Smittybilt would be to focus more design time on the entire product As it is it appears upon initial analysis that the focus has been strictly on the appearance of a sturdier built unit It is possible that this unit can handle more abuse I dont know but if it can it is not evident upon my desktop analysis Perhaps some day I will torture test them by driving over them Until then I will just see which one lasts longer under normal useNotes Both units came with batteries included Also the brightness of these products are pretty much identical as they should be with ANY batteryoperated device using these cheaper LED bulbs They should all including those not tested here be about the same brightness which is plenty bright for their intended purpose  to be seen,4.0,Wagan 45 stars vs Smittybilt 335

A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B003N9LQE4,Crookedmouth ,"[13, 13]",ESS Ice 24 sunnies are described on the companys website as a lightweight frameless eye protection system that offers a unique combination of highimpact resistance unrestricted field of view and interchangeable lenses for effective eye protection in any light condition which pretty much sums up the basicsOne key point to note is that they are ballistic tested to a US MilSpec which means that they provide rather more protection than common or garden sunnies You can find some rather interesting videos on the net which show various independent and possibly unscientific tests being performed on the lenses to demonstrate this Highlights include the lens being shot with a 22 bullet and surviving or being driven over by an SUV and surviving again Admittedly the lenses arent much use after such tests but you can at least be confident that if someone drives an SUV over your head youll be absolutely fine Its also useful to know that ICE 24s are the eyewear issued to British Army in Afghanistan and thats got to be worth somethingI bought these shades for use when offroad cycling to replace my trusty but elderly and rather less sturdy Bloc Stealths I was surprised to find that these high specification ballistic shades are only barely more expensive which was one important factor in my decision to buy themYou get the following items The smoke grey unpolarised lens for use as normal sunglasses yellow tinted highdef lens for use in low light and a clear lens for use as a simple protective eyeshield in lowno light The frame set two adjustable earbows and a nosepiece A strap that joins to the ends of the earbows and holds the sunnies securely to your face or round your neck A semirigid nylon webbing storage case A nofog cleaning clothThe lenses are interchangeable but certainly for the first few cycles it is quite difficult to detach and attach the frames and nosepiece to the lenses and I was quite worried about breaking something As far as I can tell though the parts are pretty robust so the chances of damage if youre careful are smallThe frame has been designed to be minimally intrusive which reduces obstruction to your field of view and increases airflow behind the lens to reduce he chance of fogging The lenses are also both very wide and close fitting compared to my Stealths so protective coverage is goodDespite being so chunky the 24mm thick polycarb lenses are much thicker than standard sports eyewear the whole setup is not noticeably heavy and is very comfortable to wear Ive worn them a couple of times on the trail and when running and I sweat like a donkey on Brighton Beach they havent fogged up yet The strap also does a good job of stopping the shades slipping down my sweaty noseOverall these seem to me to be excellent sports shades effective sturdy but very well designed If they had cost more they would constitute a bit of an indulgence or even a borderline luxury item but as they are they represent excellent value for moneyIMPORTANT NOTE Having used it for a little while now I can confirm that the soft case is rubbish The case includes a compartment for the spare lenses but the compartment doesnt work and the lenses pop out putting them at risk of scratching If thats likely to be a problem for you I would recommend looking at alternative storage approaches I have some spare cloth pouches left over from an old set of shades which I will be using to protect the spare lenses in the case,5.0,Excellent protection against sun dust shotgun blast and SUVs,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",5

A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000TGJ8A8,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 4]",Its risky for a story to intentionally fool with time specifically a linear sequence of events the end result will be either a uniquely constructed narrative or a convoluted mess Nextbased on Philip K Dicks short story The Golden Manis about a man who has the ability to see two minutes into his own future which is just enough of a heads up to prevent certain things from happening The idea is enough to attract anyones attention and thank goodness that it actually redeems itself by the end of the film while nowhere near as complex or thought provoking as last summers Philip K Dick adaptationA Scanner Darklyit still manages to be a thoroughly entertaining story a presummer popcorn flick with an engaging plot and decent performancesThe film opens in Las Vegas where Cris Johnson Nicholas Cage headlines a magic show under the alias Frank Cadillac When not on stage he gambles at local casinos puffing on cigarettes while trying to manipulate his odds of hitting jackpots He is of course under constant surveillance and on this particular night his antics go a little too far prompting Security to intervene The situation is made worse when he envisions a casino shooting and prevents it from happening he makes himself look guilty and hes forced to escape This sequence is loaded with plausibility problems even if you have the ability to peak into the future its still impossible to escape the everpresent surveillance cameras I should know Ive been to Vegas many times Not only can Security see his every move they also follow him closely as he darts around the casino Yet he escapes with ease He also manages to steal someones carLuckily the rest of the film succeeds in overshadowing this sequence This is when FBI agent Callie Ferris Julianne Moore is introduced shes had her eye on Johnson ever since learning of an international threat against America A group of Russian terrorists have stolen a nuclear warhead and plan to detonate it in Los Angeles which will result in the deaths of eight million people Johnsons precognitive abilities are perfectly suited for preventing a disaster of this magnitude which is why she feels justified in forcing him to cooperate After all its not about him its about saving millions of livesJohnson as you might expect is not anxious to be a pawn of the American government The most obvious solution is for him to leave Vegas and hide in some remote part of the country But he cant This is because for reasons he cant explain hes been having visions of a young woman in a local diner and he simply has to meet her and find out why This is a troubling situation when it comes to this mystery woman he can see far beyond two minutes into the future Its never adequately explained even when he finally does meet her after months of visiting the diner sitting at the counter and sipping away at martinis you usually dont associate martinis with diners but I digress Her name is Liz Jessica Biel and she befriends Johnson when he disrupts a confrontation between her and her controlling exboyfriendIt isnt until the two meet that Johnson finally decides to flee Vegas they both travel to Flagstaff Arizona where Liz teaches at a local Native American reservation Unbeknownst to them both Agent Ferris and her team are hot on their trail The same can be said for the Russian terrorists Johnson is a threat that must be eliminated at any costParts of this film play like scenes from a runofthemill Espionage Thriller much like the material of a James Bond story we have the dastardly plot to destroy a major city we have the international bad guys we have the lone figure who has the ability to stop them This was actually more of a distraction than anything else which may be bothersome to those who have read the original Philip K Dick story to say that this adaptation is unfaithful to its source would be an understatement But in all honesty a comparison is completely unnecessary I say this because the screen story stands on its own and for the most part it works Johnson is a fascinating charactersomeone both blessed and cursed with a supernatural ability that could be used for humanitys benefit But how would it benefit him If I help you he says after hes caught by the FBI and restrained in front of a TV screen youll keep me strapped to this chair forever He has a point he may be able to foil this nuclear threat but it would mean the loss of his personal freedomThe final sequences of the film follow a fairly routine structure Johnson teams up with the FBI hoping to save both the population of Los Angeles and Liz who has since been kidnapped by the Russians Johnsons ability is used to its fullest at this point this is a treat for the audience especially during a climactic sequence in an industrial complex All this paves the way for an end sequence that I didnt see coming I wont go so far as to call it a twist ending but I will say that it was unique I dont know if the same can be said for Next as a whole but so what It was entertaining just the same,4.0,Two Minutes Until ,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",6

A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000HT3QBO,Ed Uyeshima,"[9, 9]",There is no argument that Louise Brooks was a galvanizing presence during her relatively brief movie career and no one knew how better to capture her mercurial personality and timeless beauty than German director GW Pabst Certainly the deluxe royal treatment given this silent classic in the doubledisc 2006 Criterion Collection DVD package would portend a masterpiece but due to a combination of factors the 1929 film just misses its mark Part of the challenge is the deliberate pacing and extensive 133minute running time Based on two plays by Frank Wedekind Erdgeist and Die Buumlchse der Pandora the screenplay by Pabst Joseph Fleisler and Ladislaus Vajda is refreshingly frank in its treatment of sexual ambiguity and promiscuity and provides intriguing insight into the social decadence of Weimar Germany At the same time the film keeps its epic length focused on the whims and travails of an amoral rather unsympathetic showgirlprostitute named Lulu and the net effect can be somewhat enervating in spite of the potent combination of Pabsts creative vision and Brooks charismaThe plot begins with Lulu leading a comfortable life as the mistress of newspaper mogul Dr Peter Schoumln A vivacious and unapologetic flirt she also tantalizes Schoumlns nave son Alwa and the mannish Countess Geschwitz but she becomes determined to marry Peter when he announces his engagement to the respectable daughter of a government official As she readies to take the stage in a musical revue she jealously throws a temper tantrum to prevent Peter from marrying an overlong episode that exposes his lustful feelings for Lulu in front of his fianceacutee Through this twist of fate Lulu becomes socially prominent but fate deals harshly with her as she is arrested for murder and sentenced to prison She manages to escape to a gambling boat where shorn of her famous pageboy bob she is blackmailed and then winds up walking the streets of London where she eventually meets her destinyAs Lulu the stunning Brooks is credible as a tart though not quite to the Shakespearean degree demanded by the story She has moments of enigmatic power when Pabsts vision becomes palpable but she never quite transcends the tawdry dimensions of the story Her severe coquettish look has inspired subsequent generations of actresses from Liza Minnelli in Cabaret to Drew Barrymore in Fever Pitch The supporting cast is filled with typically excessive performances in particular Carl Goetz as the gargoylelike pimp Schigolch and Alice Roberts as the smitten Countess The expressionistic look of the film adds invaluably to the storys emotionalism thanks to Guumlnther Krampfs striking cinematography and Andrej Andrejew and Gottlieb Heschs modernist sets The first disc has a satisfactory print with some overexposure evident at key momentsThere is an informative if rather academic commentary track by film scholars Thomas Elsaesser and Mary Anne Doane You can listen to their comments or select among four different musical scores although the orchestral accompaniment tends to be too overpowering On the second disc are three solid documentaries  an hourlong 1998 TCM biography Louise Brooks Looking for Lulu narrated by Shirley MacLaine a new feature Shadow of My Father where Pabsts son Michael discusses his fathers idiosyncratic filmmaking techniques and a fascinating 48minute interview with a particularly toughminded Brooks produced a year before her death in 1985 by filmmaker Richard Leacock and Susan Steinberg Woll The best extra is the 98page booklet which includes noted film writer Kenneth Tynans 1979 New Yorker essay The Girl with the Black Helmet which launched Brooks renaissance,4.0,Pabsts Unblinking Look at Weimar Germany Embodied by the Iconic Brooks,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",6

A3N0AXNEZVE686,6300270122,Hound Dog,"[2, 2]",I recently took another look at the big screen debacle entitled Superman III which initiated the beloved movie franchises rocketing descent into oblivion 25 years ago  As expected time hasnt been kind to the third Superman filmIf you were to look over this films credits the potential seemingly was all there Christopher Reeve as Superman competent director Richard Lester who also directed Superman II two of the original films screenwriters a great special FX crew plus the added bonus of comedian Richard Pryor who was still semihot at the time  Therefore how could this much talent transform a likely surefire hit into such a colossal goose eggPrimarily I suspect it comes down to a lackluster script that was not even close to the same league as the first two films  The basic storyline on paper may have been okay at best but as a motion picture the franchises classy tongueincheek humor and timeless reverence to the Man of Steel pretty much evaporate in favor of incorporating Richard Pryors bumbling computer geek character Gus Gorman into the story  The result of providing Mr Pryor sufficient screen time to justify his hefty salary reduced other pivotal supporting players like Jackie Cooper as Perry White and even Margot Kidder as Lois Lane to mere bookend cameo appearances  As at least one other reviewer points out forcibly melding a Richard Pryor comedy with Superman simply doesnt workAlso the campy screenplay suffers from too few thrills with the exception of the Superman vs Clark Kent auto graveyard battle which was superb  Christopher Reeve appeared game during the various stunt sequences but the special FX while they seem initially great deteriorate badly by the time Superman enters the Grand Canyon for his final showdown with the villains  Obviously the special FX budget not to mention composer John Williams masterful score were among the costcutting decisions made by the producersAs for the other scenes there is little worth remembering about them who really wants to watch Superman being infected by tarflavored kryponite  The romantic subplot featuring Annette OToole as Lana Lang and Clark Kent was nicely handled but logically shouldnt Lois Lane have been the one instead of Lana present during the evil Superman plot twist  Once again the scripts ineffective sense of continuity comes into play hereAs for the main villains Robert Vaughn as Ross Webster is an awfully weak substitute to follow up Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor as Supermans new nemesis  I definitely agree with a fellow reviewer that Webster and his female entourage are really little more than a cheap knockoff of Lex Luthor Otis  Ms Teschmacher  If Richard Pryor had instead played Webster while eliminating Gus Gorman entirely that could have been an intriguing proposition  Personally though I really would have preferred an edgy actor like Christopher Walken much like he was in A View to a Kill and Batman Returns who could have created a creepy antagonist truly worthy of tangling with the legendary Man of SteelSpeaking of which the Ultimate Computer could have been and probably should have been transformed into a realistic variation of the classic Superman villian Brainiac  The premise of an almighty evil computer that just wants to survive is a monstrous concept that would hold up extremely well today  Unfortunately as depicted in this film the Ultimate Computer looks so incredibly phony that it becomes a major detriment to the franchises reputation for providing top notch special FXAmong the special edition DVDs bonus features there are the following 1 the making of Superman III documentary which is worth viewing particularly for Christopher Reeves interview 2 cast filmographies and 3 the obligatory trailer  Heres an interesting bit of trivia the young actor at the Metropolis photo booth seen briefly during the opening sequence also had earlier played toddler KalEl during the original films initial Smallville sequenceIn summation the two big reasons why this film fails I believe come down to an uninspired script offering little excitement and not enough laughs as well as far too much reliance on Richard Pryor and Robert Vaughn as the miscast villains  If director Richard Donner screenwriters Mario Puzo and Tom Mankiewicz and composer John Williams had all been present for Superman III they probably would have made a world of difference  Unfortunately another vintage performance by the muchmissed Christopher Reeve alone couldnt save this film from the ravages of mediocre filmmakingFinal Grade a weak 35  Christopher Reeves iconic presence as Superman is the films only enduring asset  The brief scene of Reeve flying over the Atlantic Ocean as Superman goes to rescue a crippled oil tanker made me believe I was viewing a legitimate superhero in flight not simply an actor on wiresSide Note I do however heartily recommend William Kotzwinkles long outofprint novelization of this movie  His cynical wit packs in plenty of chuckles despite the scripts weak material  You can probably find a cheap copy easily enough on Amazoncom,3.0,Superman III Its a Bird No

never sees the light of day again as its fanboys continue to drop off its inevitable Id wage everything I own on season two being less than thirteen episodesAllow me to explain while I generally believe that anything with Terminator in the title that doesnt involve James Cameron should be banned and subsequently expunged from society I was perfectly willing to give this show a fair chance since after all its TV and quality is generally expected to be below average in relation to any film counterpart that preceded it T3 excludedits far worse than this show read my review if you care The first episode however made me cringe for more reasons than I care to rememberTake for example the performance by Lena Headley Headey eh who cares Basically I thought it was as completely devoid of any real emotion as could be humanly possible There was no rage no anger no fear and far too much smiling and golucky attitude basically everything that Linda Hamilton portrayed so well in the films again I dont consider T3 part of the series managed to disappear in her performance Dont tell me its a revisioning of the character its bad acting and a failure to connect with the character that James created Dont tell me its a revisioning of the series and that its ok for her character to be happygolucky because its nonsense and you know itNext on the list is the incredibly drab characterization of the next hero Terminator naturally a teenage girlwhat else should we have expected from a TV show aimed at Joe Sixpack performed by some girl from Serenity I thinknever seen it but almost certainly equally awful and fanboysupported while it was on Does she look good Decent Does she portray an interesting envisioning of the T800 I think notNext we have the kid that was on Heroes in Season One now theres a good scifi show if you need a comparison Well hes ok in this show too but not quite the prepubescent vision of John Connor that we might expect At least hes a competent actorFinally at least regarding characters and the actors that portray them we have and this was by far the most nauseainducing experience I suffered through before I gave up completely on this drivel none other than Mr 90210 himselfMr Donna MartinBrian Austin Green OhmyGod If I had a nickel for every person who muttered those words at exactly the same moment that I did well Id use it to find and purchase a decent Terminator script or to buy off whoever has the power to pull this show from our airwaves now instead of a few months down the road Of all peopleBrian Austin Green This was unquestionably the precise moment when this show went from being simply poorly written and acted to absolutely riotousand fanboys I know youre with me on at least this point dont even try denying itMoving on from the characters lets discuss the plot Ok thats itIn summation what Terminator  The Sarah Connor Chronicles brings to the table is little more than a failed attempt to rehash a dead series it died with Cameron or as others have said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic Much like T3 and almost certainly the upcoming trilogy again with no input from Cameronbut at least Bale is involved this dog deserved a quick death and its somehow found its way to a second season as others have mentioned most likely only as a buzz leader for the upcoming films Heres to hoping that someone puts it out of its misery in some kind of timely fashion again Im guessing within thirteen episodesEdit 91508 Ouch Maybe it wont even last thirteen with the season two opener garnering only 63 million viewers just over 2 of the population  check Nielsen Wire if you dont believe itEdit 91708 Down to 55 million this weekas I predicted the fanboys are dropping off like flies Unless it rebounds and quickly its fate is sealed Good riddanceEdit 93008 Unfortunately as the show has dropped out of the top ten Monday Primetime its ratings are no longer displayed on Nielsen Wire Does anyone know of a ratings source for shows that are about to be cancelled Edit 111208 Well I stand corrected theyve decided to go ahead and finish the complete season against the forecast of virtually anyone whod been following the ratings of the show I can see however as the fanboys have stopped replying to my review that they honestly believed that the game was over as well It is in fact but not yet well true Terminator fans have to endure yet another few months of this mediocrity before its banished from our airwaves and memory Lets only hope that Terminator Salvation is relatively close to the standard set by the first pictureEdit 41409 Its official kiddies kiss this show goodnightEdit 51809 Ok so its official as of yesterday Id like to leave with one parting commentTerminator Salvation based on reviews received thus far isnt going to salvage much from the wreck that the Terminator series has becomelets hope it doesnt make us long for the twoyear awareness campaign that preceded it,2.0,Poor

rather than percieved exertion or results The bodybugg what you see on the arms of the Biggest Loser contestants enables me to not only measure how many total calories are burned during a workout but also how many calories are burned per minute This gives me a great comparison with various exercise dvdsand this one hit the bullseye Not surprisingly for something produced by an exercise channel they slam more into one move so while you dont feel like you are doing double the workout you actually are For example during leg work youll hold handweightsthis brings in upper body toningthen youll twist while doing the legworkwhich is a standing ab workout Then interspersed inside the strength building there is cardio to lift and keep your heart rate elevated When this is combined with strength training you not only have a higher caloric burn during the strength workout but the toning builds muscle revs the metabolism and keeps the heart rate up long after you are done  Because of this combo which allows for circuit training you get more bang for your buck in both caloric burn and results  Youll see the same science behind many of the Biggest Loser dvds as well for example if you are familiar with themFor me theres nothing better and I am always in search of good fitness dvds that combine an elevated heart rate with toningless work for more results Burn fat Build muscleThis according to my bodybugg rated high on caloric burnnot easy for a strength training dvd which typically is geared more to toningCUEING This is always a big one for me because Ive found that some instructors trip me up if they dont explain things well or shout out things when they seem halfway done with the moves Each instructor here was clear and easy to follow and offered excellent cueingENERGY Very high energy with upbeat music No boredom for me on this oneSET Very professional well lit gym setting and each instructor had a backup team Youll see all shapes and sizes on the dvd which for many helps motivationMOVES There are some original moves here you wont see on other fitness dvds which peaked my interest since I feel like Ive been there done that on many Yes youll have the standard ones that have been shown to work the best like squats but youll see new ones and new ways of doing things that add in both more muscle groups and good resultsINSTRUCTION While a beginner may want to start with low weights and progress up the instruction is clear enough for all levels I use heavier weights than most probably would to challenge myself but youll work every muscle from head to toe so grab the weights that are your level and advance upward to always reach better results as you improve Because you will hit so many muscles changing your resistance is all you need to allow this one to move with you regardless of your levelNEGATIVES Did we really need the severe plug for Propel water to be that obvious This isnt about the fitness aspect but to hear well break for some Propel in a second and then mention it again then see all the team grab a Propel and obviously fake chat while you have your own Propel break is sillybut heck I guess if it pays for 5 instructors to be on one dvd Ill live with itId suggest they make it less obvious next dvd that its a plug by simply saying lets break for water and then just doing a close up on the Propel label It kinda defeats the purpose this way High cheeseball factor hereCONCLUSION I think this hit all points to make it a favorite dvd of minegreat variety worked all muscles without doing just legs one day or just arms but offering complete strength and some cardio moves in each one for big circuit training results Great instruction great energyhighly recommend itALTERNATIVES If you like the toning and fat burning aspect of this dvd you may also like Kathy Smith Build Muscle Shrink Fat or Crunch Total Resculpt dvd The Biggest Loser dvds also offer circuit traning for higher caloric burn when strength training as well Just to name a few competitors that work as well,5.0,I workout daily at med to high intensityand this one is a new favorite dvd,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",6

turned 34 so when the show came on in 1990 i was 15 and a sophomore in high schoo so it really fit the bill for me Well after watching the show for year upon year the show became touch and go when they finally graduated so i caught it when i could and saw lots of episodes through the late 90s Actually some of my favorite episodes came in the later seasons when Valerie Tiffani Theisenn came into the picture spicing things up a bit with a new kind of Vixen character Here are some things i liked and disliked about the main characters sorry im not going season by season it would take foreverDylanLuke Perry would have to be my favorite simply because hes the rebel who doesnt show much emotion but is still an all around cool guy and gives the show the much needed James Dean kind of edge His battles with being car jacked his father dying being rich and always seeming to find trouble made the show not your everyday teeny bopper high school tv series To bad he left after the sixth seasonKellyI like Kelly simply because she was always thought to be a bit trampish but isnt shes really the nicest down to earth girl on the showand in real life Also yes shes hot even to this day pushing 40 years old She also added good drama to the show by not really letting anything stop her and always maintained a head strong attitudeDavid David is probably the least talented actor of the series but he gives it kind of a boyish innocents and even in the later college years has all the temptation that he had in high school just on a different level Some of my favorite episodes are with him in this season are his battle with drugs actually its the best he did probably in all the seasons that hes inAndreaEnh the Jewish girl from the poor part of town i never really cared for her character because shes always to critical of every single little detail of life also her poor me and antisemitism really gets old throughout Also much like Brandon her goals for perfection wane on you a bit throughout the years of the showSteveThe good ole big manjock styled guy on campus Steve never seemed to have a steady girlfriendexcept Celeste but always had good intentions sometimes thanks to his good buddy Brandon Also he was always picked on and never really given a lot of credit or a lot of episodes that really focused on just him Very likable guyDonnaDont get me started on Tori Spelling lets put it this way she never really made it on the show just there as the other peoples friends and davids gf To goofy for my taste and she really didnt bring anything to the table except that guys during the years mistreated her So being the producers daughter didnt help hense why she is still on the series today im sureJim and CindyEnnh they have there moments as parents but anything in the show that revolves around them seems to Seventh Heavenish for me Thats where a lot of the shows like that Felicity and Dawsons Creek stemmed from the good ole Walshes As parents they were ok but werent to pivetal in the success of the show itselfBrendaOh my my drama queen Brenda She had more drama in her life than 4000 amateur movie stars trying to make it in Hollywood at once Wine wine wine moan moan moan argue argue argue ask Brandon for advice and yell Other than that she was definately the most annoying and whoas me character on the show could she actyes but in real life i hear shes even worse than Tori Spelling But she did bring something to the show even though i hate to admit itLast but not least good ole angel perfectionist womanizer Brandon WalshI like and hate his character a lot if thats possible I like the fact he is definitely the comic relief of the show and along with Dylan is one of the best actors on the series BUT He has probably kissed more girls than any guy in porn has had sex with them I swear to god every other disc he finds some new girl that falls at his feet or wants to go to bed with him The thing i do like about him he does try to do things right a little TO right soemtimes But Brandon is definitely the center of attention for the whole show and it probably would have never been as big without him Much like Micheal J FoxAlex P Keaton in family ties brought the show stellar reviews and made it huge successMany more stars that were cast throughout were very good and brought a new flavor to the show But my review  would take 2 months to right if i tried to remember them all I chose to review this season because its the one im on and as i said im not reviewing every single one The perks of this season as mentioned were David

A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00EO2I6OM,Stephen M Lerch,"[81, 83]",Zatoichi The Blind Swordsman is an iconic well loved and well known collection of films and a TV series in Japan The character was portrayed in 26 films 27 if you count the failed reboot in early 2000s and this Criterion Collection collection collects 25 of the 26 films in one boxCriterion has either restored or received restored film elements for this release and anyone that has seen the original DVD run either the Animeigo films or the Home Vision releases you are in for one of the greatest Zatoichi treats possible The video quality even comparing DVD to DVD between the releases you cant help but see better detail and a higher quality encode over all with the Criterion Collection versionIf you are a Zatoichi fan you owe it to yourself to own this set even if you dont like me agree with having to spend more money for something you wont really use the DVDs The box is beautiful The hardcover book included is great The disc packaging is beautiful though Im not sure I love the cardboard sleeve concept Then the box that houses it all really pulls it all togetherHighly recommendedFor those wanting a longer review of the quality of the releaseVideoEvery film has been remastered there are 3 listed processes I assume given different film stocks being used change the way they are handled Frame by frame Dust dirt and scratches were repaired removed or minimized if it meant losing qualityEach Blu Ray contains 3 films 8 discs total with the exception of the final disc which contains one film Conspiracy and the extra supplementsEach film is AVC encoded and bit rates are between 2030 for the most part There is absolutely nothing to complain about in regards to the transfer to Blu RayI have not seen any issues with any of the colors or black levels Ive watched roughly 7 of the films as of this review and peeked at the supplements on disc 25 If I run into any issues in the next bunch of discs I will report it here I dont anticipate any given this is a Criterion edition but it can happenI only spot checked the DVDs but they use the remastered video and bitrates are good with no compression issuesAudioSo the Zatoichi films were all recorded in mono sound and each track here is beautifully restoredremastered from the original film elements Each is encoded or rather not really encoded but put on the disc uncompressed in LPCMDuring my viewing I heard absolutely no audio issuesconcerns Will update this review if this changesI did not check the audio encoding the DVD releasePackagingThis is one of the biggest stars of this releaseThe plastic wrapper on the set includes the back panel information you expect but the front uses the Zatoichi brown toned image seen on the Amazon listing on the back This means that if you pull the wrap off completely the artwork on the box is completely unmolested It also means if you throw away the wrap you will lose one of the best image in my opinion on this set I slipped the wrap off looked at the box and put the wrap back on Im a nutThe artwork looks fantastic if not a bit more pastel than I would maybe like Even still it looks great and the box itself is quite sturdyThe hardback book retains the pastel color scheme on the cover the interior being black and white text with an image in color and illustrated by various artists depicting the film being described on the opposite side of the film descriptionsThe only thing I dont like and its not because its ugly its actually quite beautiful on the outside is the actual packaging used to house the discs Its hard to explain how they laid this out but Ill try When you open the book style package all qualityish cardboard the right 34page34 is a cardboard page with a pouch for the Blu Ray I dont like my discs in cardboard pouches for fear of scratches especially when the set is 200 MSRP The other odd thing is the DVDs The left 34page34 flips out horizontally with 2 DVDs are needed for each film set in their own 34page34 and pouchExtrasThe Blind Swordsman a 1978 documentary about Zatoichi portrayer and filmmaker Shintaro Katsu along with a new interview with its director John NathanNew interview with Asianfilm critic Tony RaynsTrailers for all twentyfive filmsThe Blind Swordsman documentary alone almost makes the price tag worth it in this set Yeah Im overexagerating but its a powerful documentary that really shows the greatness of the character but more importantly to me Shintaro Katsu Worth watching no questionOverallThis set sweats awesome Everything about it with the packaging concerns I have disregarded is of the highest quality and caliber I wish I didnt have to buy the DVDs and could have saved a few bucks but honestly about 8 a film less than a visit to the cinema is MORE than worth it for this set in my eyes For someone who has never seen a Zatoichi film it will be a very hard sell but if you have seen an enjoyed any Zatoichi film in the past that is included in this set you will most likely appreciate this setVERY Highly recommended,5.0,Collection in hand and reviewed,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",6

A3146M037WI0WM,0790729652,Lead Cenobite You solved the box Now you mu,"[0, 3]",Until Sam Raimi made SpiderMan I think we all regarded Tim Burtons Batman as the best superhero movie even though I actually dont consider Batman to be a superhero because he has no superpowers Burton directed this movie and did a great job  this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back thenMichael Keaton is BatmanBruce Wayne Needless to say Batman is Waynes alter ego Keaton is magnificent at playing the characters alter ego Keaton also does a good job playing the character when hes not in costume Keatons Bruce Wayne isnt as gloomy as Christian Bales was in Batman Begins which isnt necessarily a bad thing But I would say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the Schumacher movies But overall Bales Bruce Wayne is superior to Keatons because Bale has a much more developed character to play HOWEVER Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than BaleThe problem with this movie is that the Joker Jack Nicholson steals the show  the whole movie revolves around him so this isnt Batmans movie This movie should have been called The Joker So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher billing than Keaton now you know The thing is the writers never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality and they barely scratch the surface of the characters background  we know practically nothing about Wayne Youd think the guy thats Batman wouldnt be so uninteresting but were bored to tears everytime Waynes onscreen and out of costume But when Keaton is onscreen in the Batman costume Batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes He plays an even more menacing Batman than Bale  so I say that Keaton does a better Batman than Bale but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton But Keaton didnt have anything to work with so its not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak But one of the strengths of Keatons performance is that if you ever met Wayne hed seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman Thats something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish but thankfully Bale was able to do itMichael Gough is a delight as the old butler Alfred Its hard to believe Gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years I assumed Michael Caines Alfred wouldnt compare to Goughs but I was wrong  theyre both great Pat Hingle was really good as Commissioner Gordon in this movie Hingle and Gough were in all four movies of the original series and I enjoyed them both in Batman Returns But in Batman Forever I didnt like them nearly as much and in Batman  Robin I found their characters annoying as hellVicki Vales Kim Basinger investigation into Bruce Waynes background is completely uninteresting But I already knew what she would find out so maybe thats why I didnt like those scenes I also found the Vicki character annoying screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreenTheres lots of little things I love in this movie The sight of Batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him and the terrified expression of the gunmen with Elfmans dramatic music blaring The look on Napiers face when he sees the emptied safe When the guy got fried by the Jokers joybuzzer one of the worst deaths Ive ever seen in a movie When the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise and the Jokers speech right before a mob boss dies The first Action News report of the movie The way URGENT is written in messy crayon on the parcel When Batman jumps through the skylight accompanied by Elfmans music The design of the Batmobile  minor changes make the car even cooler in Batman Returns When the Batmobile speeds toward the Batcave again Elfmans music is awesome The grin on the young Jack Napier The Batmobile attacking the chemical factory The Jokers facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd When the bat signal is lit  but its not as awesome as the first time its lit in Batman Returns or when its lit at the end of Mask of the PhantasmAnd now a few complaints This movie featured too many songs by Prince After a while they get unbearably annoying There were lots of other great 80s pop songs that could have and should have been used in this movie Another thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring By the way you can tell that Nicholsons makeup job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking Burtons Batwing is cooler than Schumachers Batwing but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm Anyway the targeting system of Burtons Batwing seems a little screwed up  Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker but the planes missiles and machine guns miss their target And the Joker didnt even try to get out of the way Looks like Batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systemsI always overlooked this movies flaws until I saw Batman Begins for two reasons First of all I found Keatons Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie Second of all the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is Pretty much everytime the Joker or the Batman arent onscreen the movie is boring But I must say that Batman was even cooler in Batman Returns than he was in this movie  and nastier,4.0,The Batman is AWESOME Bruce Wayne is as dull as

AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00008KA59,OverTheMoon,"[1, 1]",The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections The Original Series The Next Generation Deep Space Nine Voyager and Enterprise At around 880 minutes it is 4 episodes 1 Disc less than TNG and at least 2 Discs less than TOS However in total for the definitive Star Trek collection we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing That is 1 month of nonstop Star Trek No DVD series comes remotely close to that Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also Our very planet Earth has advanced because of Gene Roddenberrys admirable concept Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too They are like our family Watch what they do Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth What engineer medic scientist teacher worker cannot say that Star Trek has not influenced them The show is this significant in the development of our species Parents respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why The DVD case may be the best of the lot The shadowy design is foreboding of a darker trek inside The case opens to reveal the 6 discs and a collectors DVDROM of a section of a model graphic of DS9 collect all complete the computer model The discs are held in an open no cardboard covering plastic flip holder like in the TOS seasons However these collectors boxes are being replaced by the new slim line boxes that are cheaper These are simply a cardboard holder with four to five slim DVD case holders with 1 to 2 discs in each holder The slim line boxes do not contain the special collectors DVDROM There are 4 episodes per disc However the last disc disc 6 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extrasand then some more Often the bonus disc may contain the last episode or two of the season so watch out for those Sometimes the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they were filmed but in the sequence that they aired however each episode has been numbered according to the order they were filmed in This means on one disc you have shows 4 2 12 and 1 in that order The sound has also been remastered to 51 Dolby Digital Since the show was shot in full frame these dimensions are retainedStar Trek Deep Space Nine DS9 Season five is mostly about the coming invasion of the dominion alliances divisions and relationshipsThe same crew is back DS9 is commanded by Benjamin Sisko Jake Sisko is his son Odo is the stations metamorphosing police constable and a Bajoran operative Doctor Bashir is the Starfleet doctor and Chief OBrien is chief engineer Quark is a Ferengi host who owns a casino and bar Major Kira is Siskos first in command and a Bajoran Lt Commander Jadzia Dax is a Trill woman and a long term friend of Sisko assigned by Starfleet as technical advisor Gul Dukat is a leading Cardassian The Cardassian Garak has a permanent role since season four as do Quarks brother Rom and his nephew Nog who are now part of StarfleetSeason Five of DS9 is mostly about impersonations stand offs honour horrors of war wraiths time travel Worf and Dax Terok Nor cooperation visions revenge changelings traitors JemHadar prisons holograms mysterious women debt dissidents The Grand Nagus Klingon crews drugs baseball cards and the Dominion InvasionBest episodes are The Ascent The Begotten In Purgatorys Shadow By Infernos Light Blaze of Glory and Call to ArmsDS9 Season five is not quite as good as season four but a few seasons make up for it however there are a few dodgy episodes that are real misses and almost knock it back a star Aside from these the series has a definite mature direction almost building up to an end and the characters are fully fleshed out Since season four introduced the Defiant at least half of the shows have a Star Trek ship besides the DS9 station It has worked wonders to be able to trek again Bringing Worf in from season four was also a winner This season though is darker than four it has less humour and is heading towards a depressing time as the Dominion slowly flood through the wormhole preparing their attack Also DS9 is transforming into its former Terok Nor This is a very interesting dimension and maybe more fascinating than the war itself The CGI in this season stands out lots of improvements lots of space battles and lots of fighting So it is all about the Dominions plans to conquer the Federation but it plays out slowly and has a bit of a stark ending for the federation but the final images suggest that the biggest battles have yet to come So with season six we are expecting the

ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0014D5RBE,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 8]",Last year saw the return or I should say the embrace of the quirky comedy with Oscar nominee Juno garnering much attention respect and love from countless fans  Another quirky comedy that gained some awards traction but far less attention was Lars and the Real Girl a preposterous story that is elevated by some very fine performances and a heaping serving of heart  When comparing the two films I cant help but admit that my preference lies with Juno as far as entertainment goes  Juno is fast paced and engrossing quick witted and laughoutloud funny  Lars is a different breed of film altogether  It is slower paced and solemn quiet and distilled in moments and has a much deeper and quite frankly more important story to tell  Both are very good films truth be told but each has a very different effect on the audienceLars and the Real Girl tells of the strange love story between Lars and Bianca  Lars is a quiet young man who lives in the shed behind his brothers home  He keeps to himself despite his sisterinlaws efforts to engage him in conversation  He works hard and resists the efforts of young and attractive women who seem interested in a relationship with him  He is guarded and afraid and content in hiding behind his guards  Bianca is a crippled missionary exmissionary who met Lars online and has come to visit  Because of her strict religious background Lars has asked his brother and sisterinlaw if Bianca could stay with them while shes in townOh yeah Bianca is an adult blowup dollIts apparent that Lars is suffering from a delusional state of mind  He believes that Bianca is a real person and he engages her in conversation as if this were true  After seeking help from the family doctor Lars loved ones decide to play along with this charade to hopefully help snap him back into realityLars and the Real Girl definitely suspends the boundaries of disbelief especially when the entire town starts playing along with Lars delusion but the film never strays from the warmth buried at its center  The film never feels as preposterous as it truly is because it always carries a feeling of tender sincerity  This is due in large part to some very very fine performancesRyan Gosling is touching and capable as Lars Lindstrom  We see a sad and lonely man repressed by his own feelings and forced into hiding behind a false wall of security in order to spare himself heartbreak and or destitution  The only issue I have with Goslings performance is that it often feels onenote  That onenote is played beautifully dont get me wrong but it is still onenote  Emily Mortimer and Paul Schneider on the other hand prove to be the heart and soul of this film  As Karin Lars sisterinlaw Mortimer is emotionally connected to the audience  She cares deeply for Lars and is trying desperately to understand his condition  She wants to help him so much so that she almost at times encourages his delusion  Paul Schneider is even more breathtaking  He had such a banner year last year between his stunning performance in Lars and his flawless performance in Jesse James  As Gus Lars brother Paul covers each and every varying emotion shock tolerance guilt shame love desperation magically  There is a moment when Gus and Karin Lars and Bianca are sitting in the waiting room at Dagmars office and you can just read the discomfort all over Pauls face  Its marvelous acting  This man better get the career he deservesThe cast of supporting characters are all fine as well Kelli Garner embracing her characters quirks and idiosyncrasies and Patricia Clarkson who is just always on point doing her best to work with the stale psychologist role but truth be told this movie belongs to Mortimer and SchneiderI do wish that the script had been tweaked a tad in order to allow the audience to come to understand Lars a little better  The film clocks in under twohours although the film does tend to feel much longer and probably could have been lengthened a tad to allow for us to really grasp his condition  His delusion is given reasons but they are reasons that are generic and predictable and could have and should have been expounded  Maybe that would have allowed for Gosling to explore a varying array of emotions and really flesh out his characterIn the end I highly recommend Lars despite that minor flaw  The film is touching and sweet and while it is marketed as a comedy and I did laugh out loud in a few scenes it has a warmth of soul that is often not found in big budget comedies today  It feels independent and that adds a layer of rawness to the finished product  Lars and the Real Girl is a memorable film that will move you in ways you may not have imagined and that is always a good thing,4.0,Lars is the real deal,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",6

Broncos  The film features cinematography by Munn Powell The Sasquatch Team Napoleon Dynamite and music composed by David Wingo George Washington Snow Angels All the Real GirlsVIDEOGentlemen Broncos is featured in 1080p High Definition widescreen  1851  The film does showcase quite a bit of detail from the skin pores and beard of Jermaine Clement the leather jack and even the vibrancy of certain outdoor scenes especially during the scifi segments of Yeast Lords  AVC is 33MBPS skin tones are natural blacks are nice and deepAUDIO  SUBTITLESThis is where Gentlemen Broncos shines  Featured in English 51 DTSHD Master Audio and Spanish and French 51 Dolby Digital for the most part the film is dialogue and musically driven but during the Yeast Lords segments there is actually a good number of sound effects from laser shots to Bronco destroying the opposition  There is also a scene where Benjamin and his mother are caught in a car while Don Carlos is shooting at themSo for a film that is pretty much dialogue and musical driven there are spurts of action sequences in which the surrounds and rear surrounds are used But those scifi segments are not so long  So Gentlemen Broncos is a bit of mix bag when it comes to audio but for the most part audio is clear and understandable and music ranges from a few popular tracks to schmaltzy 80slike balladsSubtitles are in English SDH and SpanishSPECIAL FEATURESGentlemen Broncos comes with the following special features in High Definition with English Stereo Audio Commentary by Writer Jared Hess Writer Jerusha Hess and Director of Photography Munn Powell  Both Jared and Jerusha have fun with the commentary and keeping it fun and hilarious  From Jareds appreciation of Star Trek and discussion of ideas being pitched around and

Testicles Dart Gun Mike Whites Hair Sam Gun Practice Sams Smoothie Edgar Oliver Wrap The Spurlock Trio and Chance of a LifetimeJUDGMENT CALLGentlemen Broncos didnt do well in the theater and because the general consensus of the reviews were negative it didnt receive a national release  But the film has this quality similar to Napoleon Dynamite of taking that small town look and making the characters looks as if they are somewhat behind on the times especially when it comes to clothing and fashion stylesI did find Michael Angaranos performance as the awkward Benjamin Purvis to be quite interesting  Benjamin is a normal kid but was brought up with not much money and thus he eats vegetables and his popcorn ball  Kudos to Jennifer Coolidge who plays Benjamins mother Judith because as youll see on the special features she did a lot of improvisational scenes that even surprised the film crew when it came to dialogue  Jemaine Clement as Ronald Chevalier also did his fine share of improv  As for Sam Rockwell I was surprised he took this role as BroncoBrutus but needless to say he adds star power to this filmBut its the characters that surround him that just seems way bit surrealFrom his other Judith who just creates the ugliest fashion designs that seem very bad polyester 70ish mixed with I Dream of Jeannie and Princess Leia Dusty who seems like Napoleon Dynamite and likes to use a blow dart which he mixes his concoction with his own feces Tabitha who tries to use her sexuality to get what she wants and then Lonnie Donaho who embodies the strange and freaky guy with a bad 90s hairdo and his outstretched mouth I will say that after watching Hector Jimenez in Nacho Libre I was looking forward to seeing how he would be used in this film  In some way one can easily mistake this film as taking place in the 80s if not for Chevaliers bluetooth headpieceFor me coming into this film I was expecting the similar humor and craziness of Napoleon Dynamite but was hoping for a more entertaining film like Nacho Libre which I enjoyed  For the most part the awkwardness bad fashion style and bad music with the exception of the ending theme  Carry on My Wayward Son by Kansas are integrated into this film and I found the film to be much more gratifying as a whole unlike Napoleon Dynamite which I enjoyed only the first half of the film when comparing the twoI suppose one can come into a Hess film in the same manner as when you go watch a Judd Apatow or Happy Madison film  Its comedy that will have its share of immaturity bad jokes and but at the same time you either love it or hate it  Im used to these films and if Im entertained for an hour and half then the film has done its jobAfter watching Gentlemen Broncos by no means is the film anywhere near being a very good movie but for an awkward comedy  there were a good number of immature dumb and even a disgusting scenes one which included a vomit kissing scene but no matter how embarrassing those scenes were  I felt it worked with this filmAs for the Bluray Twentieth Century Fox did a good job on the picture quality and its audio especially during the scifi segments and there are a good number of special features includedIf you have enjoyed Jared and Jerusha Hess previous films you more than likely will enjoy Gentlemen Broncos  Im pretty open to these type of films and no matter how silly

A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0780622545,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 2]",I would agree with almost anyone who says that quotDark Cityquot is one of the most visually arresting cinematic efforts made in the last few years Alex Proyass film employs shifting set pieces hallucinatory effects downright bleak atmosphere and bizarre characters to create a science fiction tour de force of epic proportions I have never seen a movie quite like quotDark Cityquot and I do not expect to see something like this again for some time to come if ever The movie seems to divide viewers either you will like this one or absolutely detest it Either side can make strong cases for their opinions Fans can point to the devilishly clever plot the casting of wellknown actors such as Jennifer Connolly Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt in key roles and the nifty special effects work Detractors are correct when they spotlight the movies tendency to embrace style over substance the paperthin characters and an occasionally convoluted plot I am going to take the middle ground with this picture because I feel that quotDark Cityquot is a wonderful idea in terms of special effects and plot but too often fails to realize the human aspects of its storyJohn Murdoch awakens in a bathtub with a raging case of amnesia the likes of which few people have ever seen He simply has no memory of how he got into the bathtub why the lamp above his head is swinging as though someone just bumped into it or why there is a body in the other room Over the course of the next few minutes Murdoch realizes he has a wife and that the police think he is a serial killer of some sort To make matters exponentially worse a group of flying humanoids who look a lot like Uncle Fester on a diet occasionally turn up and attempt to do Murdoch some serious harm Our forgetful hero must find out who he is track down his wife and figure out why a place called Shell Beach is so important before the Festerlike creeps hunt him down Throw in a strange doctor who appears from time to time and spouts rather cryptic statements about the city an alien conspiracy that would make even the most levelheaded soul paranoid a truly mind blasting conclusion and you have all the makings of a film that will stay with you for quite some time To reveal more could very well spoil the whole movie as quotDark Cityquot utilizes each and every one of its scenes to build to a shattering conclusion This movie reminds me of quotMementoquot in the way that you need to pay close attention to what is going on in order to arrive at the ending fully informedThe special effects are the best aspect of quotDark Cityquot Proyas and gang constructed a truly frightening grim backdrop for their characters to explore The city never sees the light of day and at midnight all life in the city comes to a screeching halt The urban landscape itself is like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle capable of assuming new forms on a daily basis The film reeks of noir stylings as characters amble around in circa 1940s clothing drive outdated automobiles from the 1950s to the 1960s and occasionally banter using dialogue right out of a Raymond Chandler novel The floating Festers who appear from time to time and talk in a strange lisping accent work as well especially when we discover exactly what these creatures are and what their relation is to the humans in the city What is this place and what does it all mean A good question and one that very few of the people in the city think about let alone can answerRegrettably I thought the characters in the film often took second fiddle to the special effects and eerie plot Kiefer Sutherland does an effective turn as the nervous Dr Schreber a guy who knows everything about this city and the shenanigans taking place within its parameters but who has no idea how it all started William Hurt turns up as the meticulous detective Frank Bumstead a man who notices minute details within the conscious world but has no understanding of the reality of the city Jennifer Connolly is completely utterly wasted as Emma Murdochs barely remembered wife Any Connolly fan that watches quotDark Cityquot is sure to experience disappointment about how little she does here Rufus Sewell an actor I am unfamiliar with and whom I thought was miscast here plays the amnesia addled John Murdoch I never felt much sympathy with Sewells character and I kept thinking of other actors who should have played the part Ian Richardson turns up as one of the creepy Fester creaturesquotDark Cityquot while failing to fire on all cylinders is still an enormously entertaining science fiction film As others have mentioned it is easy to see this films influence on later blockbuster sagas like quotThe Matrixquot The extras on the DVD including a couple of commentaries cast biographies and an interactive game spare no effort to convince you that the film is nothing less than visionary In fact the producers of quotDark Cityquot even draw comparisons between their effort and Fritz Langs monumental epic quotMetropolisquot I wouldnt go that far but Proyass film is amazing on many levels and certainly makes for a couple of hours of great

A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B00005JMJ4,D Allen,"[2, 5]",After watching Lost In Translation I could sum it up as a film about hope The movie felt so great at the end and it just makes you want to laugh cry and perhaps jump for joyBill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star together in what I would consider one of the best movie about loneliness and hopefulness Bill Murray played a middle aged actor who is having a midlife crisis and then happen to meet a young beautiful woman Scarlett Johansson who is just starting out with life and really just dont know what lies ahead To say the least the two of them are fairly lonely in their trip to Tokyo and question what lies ahead Murray is on a business trip to make money from sponsors but he has a wife at home who pays more attention to their children than him Johansson plays a newly wed wife who is tagging along with her husband on a business trip She isnt sure what lies ahead in the future of the two and she is sort of depressed and feels isolated Together Johansson and Murray learn something together and both at the end realizes that life has a lot more to offer than what is in a relationshipI would say the best thing about Lost in Translation is the movies setting It is filmed on location in Tokyo Japan I never been to Japan but I have been to Korea and I can relate to the feeling of isolation but as well as a part of the culture there You cant understand what anyone is saying nor can you understand the surrounding environment and to top it off anyone you happen to meet who speaks English can speak it very well but carrying out an actual decent conversation is next to impossible I think Lost in Translation captured that very wellI think what makes this movie so special is the actors who played it out Scarlett has a very special look to her that I think fit well for this movie She has a sort of modern beauty to her but at the same time you can sort of sense that she is searching for something in life Bill Murray usually plays an arrogant stuck up character but his role in this movie used that to its advantage but also brought about something human in him You can almost feel a sense of loneliness confusion and sort of hopelessness out of his character as he is stuck in a midlife crisisThe movie ends in what I would consider thought provoking spoilers At the end of the movie Bill has to return home from Japan and Johansson is sort of sad to see him go but doesnt really know what to say or how to say goodbye So they sort of shook hands said a quick goodbye and parted Still not feeling all that great Bill is in his taxi when he sees Johansson walking amongst the crowd He tells the driver to stop and he walks up besides Johansson and they meet again both looking confused as to what to say Bill then hugs Johansson and he whispers something to her ear then parts I think this is quite possibly the best part of the entire film It sort of makes you wonder what Bill said to Johansson at the end but at the same time it gives you a bit of hope and inspiration that even though you feel lonely now and perhaps in what ever relationship you are in that there is always hope and in that it sort of brings about your purpose I think end spoilersWith such a brilliant ending wonderfully thought out actor and actress and a beautiful setting I think this movie is one of the best movies of the recent decade At the end of the film I was feeling great about myself and each time I see this movie I just think about it for days at a time I say get this movie,5.0,One of the best movies Ive seen with one of the best ending,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",6

her film career 19321943 so we are missing a few most notably the Oscarnominated She Done Him Wrong Viewing these films 70 years after they were made Mae West still impresses as a woman who had no shortage of confidence gall or wit Yet Mae West was almost 40 years old when she started in film coming off of tremendous Broadway and vaudeville success She unabashedly promoted herself as a sex symbol and irresistible temptress She did this by sheer force of will Competing with her own lavish wardrobe for the audiences attention was no small feat West wears suggestive slinky gowns but has the thick waist and sagging bustline of middle age She has a masculine gait leading with her shoulders instead of her hips I assume this exaggerated strut was developed for the stage Not only were Mae Wests characters not respectable her onscreen persona is trashy manipulative selfabsorbed coarsely mannered and generally freakish These are not the sort of women that anyone would find alluring in real life Yet Mae West made them desirable even admirable just by saying that they were And audiences flocked to see them and still do Thats why Mae West was a great star Subtitles are available in

feeling might even be mutual These prints are a little grainy but basically good with good sound Trailers unrestored for both films are included on the discDISC 2 Goin To Town 19351 hour 11 min was written for the screen by Mae West based on a story by Marion Morgan and George Dowell West plays Cleo Borden a flirtatious flamboyant performer in a Wild West saloon engaged to marry a monied cowboy When her fiance is killed rustling cattle the night before their wedding Cleo inherits his oilrich land She proceeds to fall head over heels for an English gentleman employed to speculate for oil on her property Mr Carrington Paul Cavanagh But Carrington is put off by her coarse manners and low birth So Cleo sets out to become a refined lady or some approximation of one using any means at her disposal with the help of her accountant Mr Winslow Gilbert Emery But not all ladies of high society are as ladylike as they seem Lots of bejeweled gowns and fabulous furs And we get a taste of Wests

A3APPKALUGB2GT,B0013K7ZPE,Michelle888,"[1, 1]",Allow me to mention first that ATONEMENT is neither an epic love story nor an epic war movie despite what I have concluded from the trailer  The first time I saw the trailer for this film I knew I had to see it not because I have read the book but because I was intrigued by the premise of the story  Jealousy and betrayal seemed such good basis for a grand love story  And after garnering several nominations from the sadly unglamorous Globes this year and now the BAFTAS I knew that I couldnt put off my trip to the moviesThe opening scene of the movie and the way the title ATONEMENT itself is typed letter by letter is suggestive of its import to the movie  The first part takes place on a hot summer day at an English country house  We meet thirteenyearold Briony Tallis an aspiring writer with an avid imagination  Briony has a crush on Robbie the housekeepers son which is instantly apparent to the viewers from her first conversation with him as she invites him to see her play  This film proves how we should be cautious of young girls with a fertile imagination  In the scene where she sees Robbie and Cecilia by the fountain one could almost feel the hurt and jealousy in Brionys eyes  And thus is the extent of her fanciful imagination and petty jealousy that when she witnesses encounters beyond her comprehension Briony falsely accuses Robbie of a crime he did not commit an accusation that would alter their lives foreverThe film quickly fast forward five years to wartime London While the lie hasnt destroyed Robbie and Cecilias love its devastating impact forces them apart  The film now follows Robbie as a soldier in France during the Dunkirk evacuation  Here we are greeted by several minutes of haunting images of the horrors of war  The scene moves in an almost delirious pace ending with our hero in a feverish state  Moments later and we are taken to a London hospital where we see a benevolent Briony working as a nurse  Her aspiration hasnt changed but she is wracked with guilt and intent on making amends for her mistakes  In the second and third part of the film so much focus is made on Robbie and Brionys lives that we end up losing sight of Cecilia Before we know it it is decades later and Vanessa Redgrave appears as an older Briony where the story provides an unexpected twist  Redgrave delivers a compelling performance in the very few minutes she appears leaving a lasting impression to the viewersJames McAvoy and all the Briony characters provide quite outstanding performances and once again Keira Knightly pouts  and smokes  her way through the film  My gripe which initially left me detached in the beginning was the lack of background on Robbie and Cecilias relationship  I felt that another five minutes or so of character development would have added credibility to Robbies feelings for the haughty Cecilia Instead it came across as more of a deep and unsated sexual attraction quickly remedied in the library  I also found the shifts in time quite distracting  The cinematography however is superb  That long continuous take at Dunkirk is amazing although that moving ferries wheel was distracting and seemed rather inappropriate for the mood  The film score is wonderful and very evocative of the grief and heartbreak of the characters  Oh did I mention that green dress was stunning  All in all Id say it was a good movie though I dont believe it lived up to the hype,3.0,Perhaps I would have felt differently had I read the book first,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",6

A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B004QOB8O8,Theo,"[99, 109]",There is a great deal to admire in this series Visually it is superb The costuming and sets manage simultaneously to be both beautiful and realistic to the period or at least they seem so to my untutored eye The actors uniformly do an extraordinarily good job So much so that it is difficult to know whom to focus upon in this review because whatever choices I make I will be omitting mention of some truly outstanding performancesHowever I am going to begin in the obvious place with Jeremy Irons interpretation of Rodrigo Borgia I do so if only because so much hinges on this pivotal character The Telegraph critic Rachel Ray criticised this series on the grounds that it lacks the amoral aura of a psychopathic family and specifically criticised Irons own performance as disappointingly undiabolical On a strictly literal level Rays perception of this series is entirely accurate However I would argue that it also entirely misses the pointThe Rodrigo Borgia we find in this show was never intended as an inhuman monster who would not have been out of place cackling maniacally atopSnake Mountain Rather what we gaze upon here is far closer to the true face of evil as it most often exists in the real world ordinary resigned in the face of the dictates of Realpolitik and when confronted with the moral reality of where such dictates lead by turns a true believer actively self deluding and at times even self doubting Not unlike a concentration camp guard who can go home at night and be a loving father to his children I am very much reminded here of political theorist Hannah Arendts famous phrase the banality of evil It would be doing a great disservice both to Irons individual performance and to the moral complexities of this series more generally to suggest that everything could be summed up entirely in such straightforward terms Nevertheless we would at least have the comfort of being considerably closer to the human reality of what The Borgias sets out to achieve than whatever it is Ray was expecting  apparently some kind of costumed remake of The GodfatherRodrigo Borgia aside there are many more truly outstanding performances in this series than I can realistically go into here It is worth saying that Franois Arnaud Holliday Grainger and David Oaks all do outstanding jobs in their respective rolls as Rodrigo Borgias adult children Sean Harris although in a relatively minor role as Cesare Borgias assasin is also very much worthy of mention While his performance is extremely minimalist he somehow manages to achieve a great deal while apparently doing very little I find myself genuinely left wondering what goes on behind those eyes It must take an enormous amount of skill to suggest so much with so littleUnusually for a quality drama if this series has a weakness it is in the writing Dont get me wrong the writing is good Its just that it never manages to be more than good It doesnt achieve the same standard as the other aspects of the production If I could sum up my reservations about the writing in a single sentence it would be simply this it does not surprise me I say that from the perspective of someone with a very slight nodding acquaintance with the history of the period although no more than that But to be clear when I talk of not being surprised Im not just talking about the specific events that take place Its more that there is a decided absence of moments where I find myself thinking Gee they did that well In fact there are no such moments at all until relatively late in the piece when the French King once again played impeccably in this case by Michael Muller arrives on the stage And even then the surprises  those wow moments  are few and far between and as a rule are rather mildStill its not like the writing is bad or anything Its good Solid If perhaps just a tiny bit predictable Actually this series is at its most unsettling when it communicates with us on a purely sensual level with sound and vision cannons blazing In this case literally soAnd speaking of the French one curiosity of this series is that despite being an international production with an international cast all of the Italian characters not only speak English they are made to do so with very pronounced English accents Of course when the French get involved they too all speak exclusively in English  although in their case they speak English with French accents Its little touches like this that remind us that despite its superficial mundane realism television is ultimately about communicating ideas and finally a story to an audience I suppose I just find it interesting how readily perhaps even unthinkingly we as an audience accept such methods of communicationThat particular curiosity and my reservations about the writing aside this is still absolutely something Id recommend seeing And I am most definitely waiting with baited breath for season twoTheo,4.0,Great Acting  Cinematography Solid Writing,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",6

A1C80B497LCYKA,B00005JNJV,Waitsel Smith Movie Shark,"[1, 4]",In Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan gave us the most realistic and at the same time the most faithfultocomicbook representation of Batman yet  or of any comic book hero for that matter at least until Iron Man It is a great story of origins as well as of character The film is full of quotes that tell you who Batman is and what he is about such as Alfreds Why do we fall  so we can learn to pick ourselves up or Rachels Its not who you are underneath  its what you do that defines you which Batman later repeats about himself or Batmans I wont kill you but I dont have to save you which he speaks to Liam Neesons character right before his demise Batman Begins is a welldefined story about a welldefined character that is both uplifting and meaningfulI also think Christian Bale is the definitive Batman Batman is about the costume the muscle the eyes the mouth and the voice Christian Bale has all of that Plus he makes a great Bruce Wayne and has the best Alfred you could possibly ask for  Michael Caine the perfect Rachel to be sweet on  Katie Holmes a terrific Jim Gordon to work with  Gary Oldman and the added character of Lucius Fox played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman Wayne Manor and the Batcave are both perfect Only the Batmobile may disappoint some diehard fans because it doesnt LOOK like the Batmobile  but it is fun Youve got the perfect nemesis in Liam Neeson and the perfect Scarecrow in Cillian Murphy Everything is perfect I gave the film 5 out of 5 starsNow enter The Dark KnightWhy is it that directors and producers think Batman is about the villains  its not They are merely the foils off which Batman plays Tim Burtons series featured one villain in the first film  the Joker played wonderfully by Jack Nicholson Then he started stacking villains and super heroes so that by the end of the series there was very little room left for Batman In the fourth film Batman And Robin for which Burton was not actually responsible  he was canned as director after Batman Returns and as producer after Batman Forever  there was Mr Freeze Poison Ivy Batman Robin Batgirl and a host of others Dark Knight has the Joker and TwoFace and thats one too many because it adds an additional 45 minutes to the film that kills the momentum and has the audience squirming in their seats Dark Knight should just have been about Batman and his attempts to defeat the JokerThe Joker is supposed to be funny in a warped sort of way In Dark Knight he is not nor does he even try to be So really it is not the Joker but a Jokerlike character that appears in the film Since Nolan wrote the script he can be blamed for that He doesnt seem to understand the Joker Heath Ledger is playing a psychopath wearing bad makeup That is not who the Joker is Jack Nicholson had a far better take on the Joker more reflective of the DC Comics characterHeath Ledger was not a great actor But the fact that he is dead and died at the end of this filming  probably because of the strain placed on him playing the Joker  makes him something of a curiosity That in my opinion is the only reason Dark Knight is doing as well as it is at the box office and with critics Once the DVD comes out I seriously doubt if it will sell as well as Batman Begins because by then people will have had time to think about it Its not a great film It is a good film but it has some major problems  besides the length which is almost three hours What does Ledger actually do in Dark Knight that could be interpreted as acting other than lick his lips so many times that it becomes annoying Hes playing a crazy man How hard can that be Mel Gibson made a career out of playing crazy people Its not that difficult The Joker character should be more than thatBatman Begins was a straightforward story about origins and character and was full of memorable quotes The Dark Knight is a convoluted story about what we can become if we focus too long on darkness Duh The only memorable quote from the film is Harvey Dents comment that is later taken up by Batman You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain Dent actually fulfills his own prophecy but Batman luckily does not But its an idiotic quote that history has easily disproved And that is enough to hang a plot on At the end of the film when TwoFace has been stopped and Commissioner Gordon is trying to explain to his son and to us what has just happened it is a tangled mess of meaningless ideas that is drowned out by the blaring music Nolan dug himself into a hole and he could not for the life of him explain his way out of itIn addition to the convoluted story and web of empty themes the actress playing Rachel Maggie Gyllenhaal is a poor and homely substitute for Katie Holmes One wonders what Nolan and his casting director were thinking  even though she gets killed off which is some consolation I guess that opens the door for Catwoman Everyone else in the cast is good but Nolan gave them less to work with this time around than he did previously Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent who later becomes TwoFace is the second major focus of the film after the Joker What a mistake to have two scenestealers in the same film so that Christian Bale as Batman is really playing third fiddleHeres a clue as to how good Dark Knight is as compared to Batman Begins when I came out of Batman Begins people were excited and raving to each other about the film like they had been to a wedding or a sporting event I watched their faces as they came out of Dark Knight they were solemn and quiet like they had been to a funeral THAT tells me a lot Something died in Dark Knight Was it the series Im not looking forward to the third film because I have a good idea what is going to happen I hear Bale has a threefilm contract so it is inevitable If Nolans third film is as stacked against Batman as this one was if it is as convoluted if the themes are as meaningless and the story as empty there will be no dead actor to draw people to the box office  hopefully Nolan is going to have to do some soulsearching in my opinion if he is going to recapture the magic of Batman BeginsWaitsel Smith,5.0,BATMAN BEGINS VS THE DARK KNIGHT,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",6

A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,6303257844,John MovieAddict,"[3, 3]",Youre going to say one thing after watching quotSpeedquot and that will be quotWhoaquot This is an action film as exhausting as quotDie Hardquot and as exhilarating as the quotTerminatorquot movies It moves with the pacing of a John McTiernan picture and it has the perfection of a James Cameron action film Its director Jan De Bont has worked on such films as quotDie Hardquot and quotThe Hunt for Red Octoberquot so its no surprise that he bears a resemblance behind the camera to McTiernanThe film is blunt fastpaced and extremely exciting It stars Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven a Los Angeles bomb squad member as cool as he is decisive Jack has been called into duty along with his partner and friend Harry Jeff Daniels to stop a madman bomber Dennis Hopper who has taken control of an elevator and will drop it to the ground unless his demand of three million dollars is metJack takes his chances and ends up saving the day but not before Harry is taken hostage and survives with a bullet shot Howard Payne Hopper is dead blown to pieces by his own bomb and so they all go have a drink and party till the moon goes down and the sun rises up You get the ideaBut Payne didnt really die and now hes very mad at a certain somebody who foiled his last plan Hes spent a lifetime being treated as dirt and he has convinced himself that he deserves the 3 million more than anybody else Jack begs to differ but he has no time to argue when Payne reappears and triggers a downtown bus with a bomb The catch If the bus accelerates past 50 MPH and then drops below that point as beforekaboomJack manages to board the bus but not before it reaches 50 and not before the bus driver gets shot by a criminal on the bus and Annie Sandra Bullock has to play driver for the rest of the day The problem is downtown LA during rush hour is not exactly open to a large bus so with the help of the LAPD the bus is driven to a deserted stretch of highway where they have a limited amount of time to either disarm the bus or pay up the sum of money to PayneMeanwhile Howard Payne is monitoring everything from his position in an apartment in LA where he has a gadget wired up to the security camera in the bus so that he can watch everything thats happening If anyone tries to get off the bus or if anyone tries to be a hero he presses a little red button andkaboom Only this time hes determined not to failThis is a ludicrously and ridiculously delicious plot Im surprised it hasnt been done already Well actually it sorta has Yes this film bears an uncanny resemblance to quotDie Hardquot only on a bus but you know what Its just about as good Its exciting humorous and absolutely fun from start to finish It never stops to go into boring conversations back at the FBI headquarters that so many action films do to try and make them look smarter It never lets up for a moment once it startsAll good action films have comedic relief and quotSpeedquot  apart from occasional witty remarks between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves andor Dennis Hopper  has Alan Ruck and Jeff Daniels You may remember Ruck as Cameron Frye in John Hughes quotFerris Buellers Day Offquot 1986 and you may remember him from the television show quotSpin Cityquot and here he plays a tourist who isnt really able to understand the situation theyre in on the bus quotThe airportquot he says as the bus swerves down a runway quotIve already been herequotDaniels is one of cinemas great character actors with dry subtle humor He can do dramatics quotGettysburgquot he can do comedy quotDumb and Dumberquot and he can now do action It takes an odd sort of acting genius to subtly upstage Jim Carrey but he did just that in quotDumb and Dumberquot by making a subtle goofball out of his character Harry Dunne Here he does the same with the sort of bleak sarcastic quips he was born to sayJan De Bont knows how to film action Just when you think everythings going to slow down after the bus finally stops we realize its just the beginning Payne kidnaps Annie takes her to a subway train and tries to run away with her to lure Jack It works And in the climatic gripper Jack and Payne fight on the top of a speeding subway train It was done in quotMission Impossiblequot a small number of years later but this came first And the film is betterCan Keanu Reeves act Hardly He does his usual quotWhoaquot routine here where his lines primarily consist of long pauses and quotHuhquot quotWhatquot quotWhoaquot quotWowquot quotFk mequot quotBogusquot and so on But an action film doesnt need a good actor and Reeves fits the part It was his breakthrough action role  without it he never would have appeared in quotThe MatrixquotquotSpeedquot is one of the great action films It bears similarities to quotDie Hardquot quotLethal Weaponquot quotRoboCopquot quotTotal Recallquot quotThe Terminatorquot 1 and 2 quotPredatorquot and all those other hardpunching action films with a fast pace and a real kick it doesnt bear resemblance to all of the films as much as the raw force behind them You know the kind of hard action flicks I mean  the kind that make you feel beaten up by the time its all over The kinds that make you leave the theater bruised and swollenYoure going to be going 50 miles per hour watching quotSpeedquot and in this case

A1EOAR5DG2OZ95,B005ZSVZRY,Christopher Lee,"[2, 2]",This unit gave me a bit of a scare when I first received it namely because after I charged it up from the wall it wouldnt charge my Samsung Galaxy Nexus  The phone reported that it was charging but the battery levels just kept dropping  I let it sit for a little while then hooked it up to mySamsung Galaxy 40 Android MP3 Playerwith the latter at 10 charge  The charger performed flawlessly and later on charged my Nexus just fine  Read on for the detailsPROS Nice solid design  While its built from light plastics theres no creaking or flex in the chassis  Its also small enough to fit easily into most bags and even some mediumsized pockets  While youll have to deal with the cable the included adapters mean that at least youll only need to bring one Great capacity for the price  Even if you never use the panel youve got enough juice in here to fully recharge your depleted phone and then some besides  While I dont believe the true capacity is 4000mAh see cons and another review on here its not bad for a cheap charger The solar panel is a nice touch  While it doesnt charge that quickly its useful on long drives or just letting it passive charge while not in use  The light indicators make it pretty clear when youre in enough sunlight to charge although they provide little information as to how fast the battery is filling up The panel actually will charge in some office lighting just dont expect it to be fastCONS As noted in another review I sincerely doubt that this backup sports a 4000mAh cell  My CDMA Galaxy Nexus has a battery capacity of 1850mAh and the status lights reported that the device was half full give or take after charging about 80 of the Nexus battery  Im pretty sure its a little less than 4000mAh The documentation is not terrible but its not helpful either  The important thing to remember is that the battery will not charge your device unless you turn it on  When you hold down the silver button for about three seconds or so you should see the four status lights come on or however many come on depending on how much power you have left  At that point your device will begin to charge  Once youre done or if your device is full hit the button again to switch it off  Once your batterys charged the backup battery will turn off The solar panel will not charge the battery very quickly  You can use it to trickle charge your device but be aware that it is a losing battle  I think I read somewhere that in ideal conditions this panel will charge at a rate approaching 250mAhhr which would mean 16 hours of perfect sunlight to fully charge the cell  Thats never going to happen unless you live on the equator  Think of the solar panel less as a way to charge the backup so much as a supplementOn the whole this is a good purchase but have no illusions about how fast the panel will charge,4.0,A solid charger that happens to have a solar panel on it,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",7

A2DKQQIZ793AV5,B0012OP7HE,Twister,"[0, 0]",I usually start with description of the package but in this case I wanted to mention the actual mail box it came in with a distinct sticker stating their 30 years of Etymotic Research innovation The box itself has a very premium feel and look that sets a nice tone for a product After taking headphones out of the box you cant help to notice how light they are  at 04 oz for headphones with eartips and inline remote this is super light You also get a premium soft pouch case a shirt clip a bit tough to remove from a cable though a set of 3 additional eartips and something very unique  a solid metal filter removal tool with 2 replaceable accufilters that incorporate wax filters Eartips are not your typical silicone domes you see with other brands You get two pairs of tripleflange tips in standard and small size a pair of barrel foam tips and a pair of mushroom shaped glider tips Upon closer examination of headphones you quickly realize why you need all these special tips The pistol shape design of headphone has a very elongated ear piece that goes deep into your ear canal thus a reference by some of calling HF2 headphones as canalphones Selection of eartips for these headphones is very crucial you either get a premium audiophile sound or tiny stock earphone sound I found foam tips to be too big while gliders didnt stay secure in my ears although they were the most comfortable and tripleflange were too uncomfortable although I probably going to use it later for my ear wax removal So what did I ended up with I went back to my trusted Comply Foam tips I had TSX100 handy which fits perfectly with these headphones One word of advice since HF2 already has a filter with earwax guard x model is an overkill since it has its own earwax built in filter and HF2 earphone piece is long enough to pock it out therefore TS100 model or T100 would be suited betterYou do need to start with a proper burn in since these are armature drivers and out of the box you need to prep them to exercise the drivers whitepink noise loop is the best for this task A proper seal of your ear canal is the key to make HF2 shine and I was successfully able to execute that with Comply tips Once you get a perfect match  hold on to your seat because you are in for a real treat The sound is VERY balanced and by that I mean a super clean and transparent clarity throughout entire frequency range at all volume levels I was able to focus on every detail of the sound from warm and natural sounding low frequencies to a crystal clear and vibrant highs and mids that very perfectly balanced in between without been too exaggerated or recessed If you are looking for a fun signature sound with a typical vshape EQ or if you are a basshead  these will not be for you unless you start tweaking the EQ But if you want to appreciate the original content of the sound if you care about the accuracy of how its being delivered and if you want to submerge yourself into one of the best passive noise isolation I have experienced  then by all means HF2 is for you I quickly started to compare these to my other headphones such as UE600 and S4A and MDuo and quickly realized how far ahead they stand in sound quality As crazy as it sounds I actually compared these 99 currently on sale at Amazon to my 400 quadarmature driver UE900 and to my ears the mids and highs very pretty damn close Of course UE900 has 2 dedicated armature drivers for the bass only and thats where it stands above HF2 but we are talking about headphones that cost 4x as much I was also very pleased with a soundstage of HF2 where I felt precise placement of every instrument and it sounded very natural rather then too wide and exaggerated even with crossfeed selected on my Neutron media playerWithout a doubt these have a superior sound quality but it comes with a few additional surprise bonuses I consider these to be audiophile quality headphones which often dont include inline remote In this case you get a very compact soft touch inline remote with a single multifunction button and built in high quality mic I found the remote to work perfect with my Note 2 and everything got executed as expected with a single button click to playpause audio and video as well as pickuphangup the call doubleclick to skip next and tripleclick to skip prev track and long press to voice activate Google Now I was very pleased with a distance of the inline remote relative to my ear and how well it picked up my voice where people on the other end told me it sounds like I was talking right into the phone Other important design details worth mentioning too Earpieces have a very nice soft touch finish and a great strain relief which makes it very easy to handle these Also Kevlarreinforced cables are tangle free and eliminate any microphonics effect Furthermore I really liked how its 270 degree angled 35mm jack was easy to handle and protected cable from pulling A special mentioning goes to included tool to remove accufilter something you would expect to be included with premium audiophile headphones at least twice the price At first I thought that little filter was only used for its waxguard but after removing it and trying to listen without it  I definitely heard a difference where it sounded less harsh with a filter in There is one more thing I would like to mention and its AWARENESS app provided by Etymotic to control a sound based on outside noise Unfortunately I wasnt able to get it to work on my Note 2 although I know it works fine on iDevices Perhaps its still a work in progress and I will update my review later once I test a working versionOverall I want to say that I just found a pair of my next FAVORITE headphones thats how strongly I feel about these For 99 we are talking about audiophile quality headphones with a superior accuracy and a very impressive passive noise isolation With a bonus of inline remote with mic and replaceable filter and 2 year warranty the value goes up Just dont expect heavy bass and make sure to invest into comfortable eartips and you have a pair of IEM that compare and surpass quality of others which cost twice as much Also I hope in a near future to have an opportunity to test one of their premium ER4 models If the sound quality of HF series stands that high I cant even imagine how much you can improve it further,5.0,Amazing audiophile quality at a fraction of the price,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",7

A110G2E0P3Y7KB,B00DQCUVPI,PogTx,"[0, 0]",I compared all wireless chargers listed on Amazon and I believe the Koolpad to be the best value available at this time Sure there are pads available for half the cost but if you read the reviews there is a good chance you would be disappointed with the product Moreover the Koolpad is still about half the cost of the Samsung charger kit and by many accounts performs better additional the thicker replacement battery cover in the Samsung kit prevents the use of many casesMany of reviews complained of an annoying beep when the phone and charger are mated and a more expensive muted version is available alternatively the regular unit could be hacked to disable the beeper  Yet I ordered the regular unit and found that it DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY ANNOYING BEEP  Apparently the company has discontinued the beeper it is totally unnecessary as the unit has a nice easytosee but nonintrusive LED green light on the surface which turns blue when the phone is mated and charging begun  I would have liked it if the blue light would turn back to green to alert you that charging was complete it stays blue but you can easily determine this from the LED Indicator lights on the on the top left of the GS4 which show red when charging and green when completely charged the LEDs only show up after the display light goes out usually in about 610 secondsA major plus for the Koolpad is that the power distance an indicator of ability to unit to charge the phone through a nonmetallic case over 212 times that of most cheaper chargers 8mm vs 3mm or 516 vs less than 18  The Koolpad does NOT come with a power adapter but this is actually good since it saves you money over the unnecessary and inferior adapters that come with cheap units since you simply use the more powerful Samsung OEM or stock power adapter which is rated 20A instead of the meager 5 to 10A of most cheaper units  Charging time seems no longer than with using the cord and the unit does not run hot  I have not tested if the companys power distance claim of 8mm is accurate but I do know that my GS4 phone starts to charge immediately after placing it on the charging pad charging right through my Incipio 2layer case hard shell with a silicone linerThe charging base is a smooth plastic about the same dimensions as the GS4 making alignment or pairing simple but it is easy for the phone to slide offcenter if bumped  One easy and effective workaround is to install 2 rubber bands around the base one at the top and one at the bottom about 34 from the ends  This totally prevents the phone from shifting accidentallyRegarding the need for an internal receiver with a Qi chip I purchased a MOCREO one since it was eligible for free Prime 2day shipping as was the Koolpad and both arrived in the same box  Cheaper receivers can be ordered but shippinghandling fees generally make them more expensive and certainly increase the delivery time  If you have Amazon Prime I suggest you order the MOCREO receiver the only other receiver that I saw that was eligible for Prime shipping was significantly more expensive  This unit can be installed instantly and works well it has good recessed contacts that make secure connection with the phones terminals a complaint about some cheaper receiver pads and are held in place securely simply by the back cover which only bulges slightly and does not interfere with my Incipio case in the least  I found no NFC interference with this receiver pad,5.0,BUY this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",7

AKKXYLLFVCHGW,B002YFDRHW,Brian Fuchs,"[144, 175]",Lets face it the battery life on the iPhone is awful  While I dont see myself as any sort of power user Im lucky if I end the day with 5 left on the phone  I chose New Trent formerly iMaxPower because I rarely see products from any company on Amazon that are consistently rated 4 14 ro 5 stars across the board  Every review praised the quality of the product and even better  the technical supportI needed a case with battery for my new iPhone as well as a standalone booster charger because our family is going on a 6hour plane trip and I need the iPhone to last the entire trip  My kids are also bringing their DSi so we needed the booster to charge that as wellSo this review covers all of the New Trent products I purchased the IMP130 IMP550 and IMP880IMP130The IMP130 is an iPhone case that contains an integrated 1700mAh battery  That battery is higher capacity according to wiki than the one in the iPhone 3GS which is supposedly around 1219mAh  Capacity isnt everything battery quality varies greatly  After using the IMP130 for a week or so I estimate the it to effectively double my time between chargesThe IMP130 case completely covers the iPhone other comparable cases leave the top exposed  To put the iPhone in the case you detach the top of the IMP130 case and slide the iPhone into the bottom part where it docks to the standard Apple connector built into the case  You then have the option to reattach the top piece providing protection to the top of your iPhone or leaving it off  The only reason to choose to leave the top part off is that when the IMP130 is fully assembled access to the iPhone buttons is difficult at best  You need to use your fingernail to mute the phone and access the volume controls  I hope New Trent addresses this in a future version  The standby button and headphone jack are much more easily accessible  NOTE If you do decide to leave the top off the case there is not much friction holding the iPhone in the bottom part of the case  It feels secure but I would not trust it  I dont think the designers expected you to use it that way but the case design is very clean even without the top piece as if it was designed with that in mind  I find no degradation in 3G signal due to the case nor are the speakers degradedNow the best part  for those of you who like me have a fullbody Invisible Shield on your iPhone the phone WILL stil completely fit in the the IMP130  I have not heard of that with any other caseThe IMP130 is about 34 the weight of the iPhone so it almost doubles the overall weight It also adds a bit of bulk around all sides  but provides a good feel in your hands  The texture of the case provides a good amount of grip but I still prefer the grip the Invisible Shield provides  To me the IMP130 case could use a little more antislip textureThe IMP130 is charged through a standard Micro USB cable included  Say goodbye to the proprietary iPhone cable  This is a very good thing  The case has an onoff switch in the bottom  When the switch is Off you are running on your iPhone battery  When the switch is On you are still using the iPhone battery but it is being charged at the same time by the IMP130 battery  When the IMP130 finally gives out the charging indicator on your iPhone turns off and you are solely using the iPhone battery  Whether the switch is on or off you can still sync through the Micro USB cable  Any offtheshelf Micro USB cable will work with this product  Heres the typical scenario you come home with your iPhone at 90 charge and your IMP130 at 0  You connect the cable to your PC to do your sync  The IMP130 begins to charge and the iPhone starts to charge once the IMP130 has enough juice  After a couple of hours both are at 100  The IMP130 has 3 LED indicators that show the current charge 10066330Finally  and this is a GREAT one  the IMP130 has a builtin superbright white LED that can be used as a flashlight say goodbye to those stupid flashlight apps  It also solves the problem of those impossible lowlight pictures  The LED has a switch to turn it on or offIn all the IMP130 is really a great product  The only negative is the hardtoaccess volume and mute controls  And remember if you have an Invisible Shield full body wrap it WILL fit in the case nicelyIMP550While the IMP130 is great theres no way it will take the iPhone on a 6hour flight of pure video and 3D games  So thats why I also got the IMP550  This is a brand new product from New Trent  Its the big brother of the IMP130 much bigger in fact  It has a very large 5500mAh capacity  That pretty much quadruples the iPhone batteryUnlike the IMP130 this case does not fully enclose the iPhone it leaves the top exposed  granting easy access to all of the iPhone buttons  The case is lined with a velvety material which not only feels neat it helps keep the iPhone in place  An iPhone with a fullbody wrap Invisible Shield DOES fit in the caseAlso unlike the IMP130 the sync interface is not Micro USB but rather standard Apple  That means there is no cable included with the IMP550 you can use your original cable that came with your iPhoneBecause this is a serious battery the case adds serious weight to your iPhone as well as bulk  mostly overall thickness  However unless you have very small hands I think you will find that the case feels much more comfortable in your hands than the iPhone itself  I find it to be quite ergonomic  I also find the grip of the IMP550 to be slightly superior to that of the IMP130The IMP550 does not have an onoff switch it provides a charge to the iPhone when it needs to  Like the IMP130 you will charge both the case and the iPhone while you are connected to your PC wall charger or car chargerPersonally I dont think the IMP550 is suited to be a fulltime case solution for your iPhone  It is simply too bulky and heavy for that as is any other 5000 mAh battery case  Its great for long trips golf courses or any other time you will not have access to a charger for many many hoursSadly the IMP550 has no flashlight LED maybe on their next revision  Three LEDs indicate charge and a fourth tells you if the IMP550 is charging your iPhoneIn summary  another 5star productIMP880When I am on that long trip my iPhone is covered by the IMP550  But what about my kids DSi and my wifes smartphone not everyone has an iPhone  New Trent has that covered too  The IMP880 is a standalone battery that charges a multitude of devices  It has a staggering 8800mAh of capacity  almost two IMP550 worth or roughly 67 times the capacity of an iPhone  Thats some serious capacity  The unit is quite small  about the size of a mans wallet  It weighs about the same as a mans wallet before a Vegas tripFour LEDs indicate battery charge and a Test button lets you know the current capacity  NewTrent made a Youtube video demonstrating this unit  In that video they say you need to turn the unit on by holding down the Test button for 5 seconds before you charge something  I find that the unit always charges a device if needed maybe I have a newer revisionThe battery may be small but the wall adapter used to charge the IMP880 is not  The Youtube video shows a nice small wallwart  My unit came with a very bulky inline AC adapter  It is larger than the IMP550 itself  Not a big deal but much larger than I expected  Remember the AC adapter is something you pack in your suitcase you carry the small IMP880 on the plane fully chargedThe IMP880 can charge a variety of items and has several portsDCIN jack connects to the AC adapter  This is how you charge the IMP880 from the wallDCOUT jack is only used for charging specific notebook PCs  My unit included a cable for this but I am not certain NewTrent will support notebook charging going forward  I do not see notebook devices listed as charge targets any longer on their websiteTypeA USB connector is used to charge your iPhone Blackberry or DSiAt this point I need to speak about the USB cable that is included with the IMP880  The IMP880 replaces a smaller charger called the IMP500  This was the workhorse of the imaxPower line of products  In fact the IMP550 is basically the IMP500 designed into an iPhone case  The reason I bring up the IMP500 is that  like the IMP880  it charges devices through a USB cable  This cable has a standard USBA connector on one end and a generic adapter on the other  You can configure the cable for different devices by connecting a different plug on the adapter end  That way you can use the USB cable to charge an iPhone or Blackberry or DSi etc  The USB cable that was included with the IMP500 had a FEMALE adapter on the end  All of the flavors of connectors had a male adapter  The USB cable that is included with the IMP880 has a MALE adapter on the end  All of the flavors of connectors have a female adapterSo what does this mean  For me it meant a slight problem when I tried to use the IMP880 to charge my kids DSi  You see neither the IMP880 nor IMP500 come with a DSi adapter  Not a problem  the website clearly points that out  So when I purchased the IMP880 I also bought the only DSi adapter they sold it was about 5  Unfortunately that adapter is male and only fits the IMP500 cable  It will not fit the USB cable that came with the IMP880My solution was to then buy an IMP500 USB cable  NewTrent sells them and so does EBay  But that means I now have one cable that only fits the DSi adapter and another cable that fits all my other devices  Plus I had to spend money on the extra cable  NewTrent says they are working on the problem and will standardize on the cableAgain this was only a problem for me because I wanted to charge a DSi  All my other charging needs are met with the cable that comes with the IMP880By the time you read this the issue may have been resolved but contact the company if you intend to use the IMP880 to charge a DSi or consider getting the IMP500 insteadWhen the IMP880 is charging a device the IMP880 remains cool  I believe the main reason for this is that NewTrent has a current limiter in the IMP880 that keeps charging current lower than what you get from a wall or PC  Devices will charge slightly slower but the IMP880 will not get hotOn those very long trips the IMP880 can charge either the IMP550 or IMP130 directly  NOTE I am told by the company that this is not a wise thing to do on a daily basis but a few times on a long trip is fineBecause of the adapter compatibility issue Id have to give the IMP880 4 stars  Id ding it more for the trouble I went through except it just works so darned good  I had the time to get the adapter issue straightened out had I discovered this the day before my trip Id not be so happyA word about NewTrent customer service EXCELLENT  I had a couple of questions that I sent via Email  I asked if someone could call me back and I got a phone call within 10 minutes  from the owner of the comapny  Show me one other company where this happensConclusionThree great products from a great company  The customer support quality is amazing  What is also amazing is how poorly written the instruction booklets are  If you want to see the devices in action there are videos on the website that explain it all but hopefully this review did that as well,5.0,Great product but read this review before using with

A3VVMIMMTYQV5F,B00BJL133C,Johnny Saigon,"[357, 373]",What is there to say about this phone If I just write about it Im just going to ramble on and on So to save everyone some grief here are bullet points my direct comparisons are to the iPhone 5 Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2 but mainly to the Galaxy S4The Good1 THE SCREEN If there was such a better screen on a phone I have not yet seen it The iPhone 5 is lauded for its excellent screen but at its current resolution it trails behind the Ones screen by far Everything just POPS out at you Even in direct sunlight everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT I really loved the Droid DNAHTC Butterflys screen but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 47 1080p468ppi form This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now  WOW2 THE DESIGNHARDWARE Why do most reviewers laud the iPhone 5s aluminum construction so much when it chips and nicks so easily If you want a true masterpiece in design and craftsmanship look no further The One feels THICK and TOUGH I dont have to worry about carrying this around caselessexcept from drops which is a whole other case I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5 Personally it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship It oozes style and sophisticationcoughSamsungahem3 THE DUAL FRONTFACING SPEAKERS We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy tinny mono speaker I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers  whatever happened to phones after that Whoever agreed to a monosolo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter FINALLY someone has the senses to come back to reality  thank you HTC Trust me your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this Especially when you use ringtonesalerts that were specifically created for this phone the sound is loud immersive expansive and POPs into your ears Its simply a rerevolution4 THE CAMERA I dont use my phone camera to make prints from photos I have my dedicated cameras for that So to me the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenienceaccessibility  it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly with decent enough quality to post online Therefore the 4MP size in the Ones camera does not bother me at all Who cares if the camera isnt THE BEST phone camera ever Because it is not but it is a GREAT lowlight shooter and to me thats more important than pixel count The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras therefore it can capture a lot more light which in laymens terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can Also the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous  this camera is quick quick quick5 For a near 5incher its quite svelte at least at the girth Its easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S3S4 and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 2 It fits in your hands nicely and securely with just the right combination of size weight and balance6 The UI and software design is now very minimal and simplistic For better or for worse if you are used to the old Sense UIs you will need some readjusting Personally I like this new one better If youre a casual news reader then youll like new default home screen which displays a gathering of news sources  some of its own partners some for your Facebook and Twitter etc  to form a Flipboard style of news reader Personally Im a huge Pulse news reader fan so I only use thatThe Bad and Ugly1 The battery is only 2300mAh  I wish it was bigger because Im one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged just in case of you know something But so far its been holding steady at about 40 at the end of the dayfrom 9am6pm I check emails read the news text Facebook etc throughout the day  I would say that Im a moderate to heavy user Another bad thing that Ive noticed is it charges slower than most other phones2 Comparing features with the Samsung S4 the One is lacking Its not a deal breaker but for those who like fancy functions the One will not make you as happy The HTC One is very simple in its feature set The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay where the phone can sense that youre looking at the screen and wont dimturn off the screen  that was a HUGE convenience for when youre watching a movie or reading the news3 Like I wrote earlier the size is both good and bad and its also heavier than most similar phones Its taller than the S4 and with the power button up on top its almost impossible to do onehand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons The buttonspower and volume dont protrude enough to make it easy to press themAll in all I feel the combination of the Ones screen designcraftsmanship and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4s fancy functions The S4s screen is almost just as good  AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation while the Ones is much better in direct light The S4 has a higher MP camera therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight while the Ones camera is more versatile and MUCH better in low light conditions The One has a much better audio experience while the S4 gives you better convenience with its features  userability goes to the S4 for sureBut in the end considering the totality of things I feel the HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience and is the king of the smartphones right now,5.0,The ONE to Rule Them All,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",7

A2AF0NOCM71J0B,B00ARF428E,G Cox Shanghaied,"[8, 9]",This is a lightweight shaver with three module attachments  The rotary shaver blade module is so much quieter than the linear blade detachable module  Also the rotary blade module shaves much faster and better if you have gone a couple of days without shaving  If you have a goatee beard neither of these attachable modules is ideal  With the rotary blades you cannot get close enough to the edge of your beard or sideburns  The linear module has shaver blades on each side so it you get close to your beard it will start cutting your beard  So I still use a conventional disposable razor to do a final dry shave afterwards  However the linear blade modules edge trimmer does shave body hair extremely well and without cutting or irritating your skin in the processFor comparison I have a six or seven year old Braun shaver that I have used every day  My old Braun 7526 razor shaves closer than either of the module attachments on this Philips Norelco shaver  The Braun is much noisier and far heavier  Also the Braum will really irritate your skin with the extendable edge trimmer if you are not careful to barely touch your skin to remove body hair  So to trim body hair I think the Philips Norelco shaver is far superior and should work equally well for male and females alike  There is a plastic attachment guard to control the depth of cut for stubble if you want longer stubbleIt includes a third module that resembles a regular barber hair trimmer In fact if you are adept at cutting hair you can use it to trim hair Or you can use it to create a stubble appearance if desired  I think stubble is already out of fashion now however  I never understood that fad anyway  There is a variable adjustment at the other end of the trimmer to push the plastic cover further away from the trimmer  However when I tried to use it with the plastic attachment it just pushes my hair out of the way and didnt cut anything at all  Maybe I dont know how to use it properly  I prefer to use it without the plastic guard  Then you have to be quite careful because it can really cut hair very well without the plastic guardSo in summary this Philips Norelco is very versatile with its three detachable grooming modules that can be pulled off and snapped back on in 180 degree positions  It takes a little force to pull the modules off or snap them back in place but very simple after you do it a few times  The razor is designed to only be used with the internal rechargeable battery  There is a warning sticker not to use it when the charger is plugged into the wall socket,5.0,Quite Versatile Shaver With 3 Module Attachments,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",8

A27MX4Y22QZW1N,B00CW7KK9K,Etienne,"[2, 3]",I like gadgets and figured I might as well blow some gift card money on a fitness device  I have a Withings scale which I very much like for tracking my not so slim figure  The Pulse had mostly good reviews and the scale certainly helped tip the balance in favor of sticking with Withings  So I want to like this thing but cannot recommend itThe packaging was easy to open It comes with a short USB charging cable no power brick included wrist band for night time tracking of your sleep and a silicone rubber beltpocket clip for daytime use  The device itself is small as displayed with a matte outer skin and easily fits into the clip and wrist band although it must be oriented properly in either holder as the blood pulse rate sensor is not centered on the Pulse something to know if you try to mount it into either holder in the darkStarting it up was easy although mine needed a charge before it could do much more than power up and off  Once charged I did not time it but it was easily charged off a monitor USB port in less than 30 minutes it was easy to sync with my Android phone after firing up the Withings app  It syncs with your Bluetooth device automatically but can be easily manually synced I tried without issue  At first the display rather worried me as I thought I had a defective unit since it is slightly blurry in appearance for lack of a better descriptor  It took me some time to adjust to the display and now I am OK with itThe wrist band is sturdy in appearance and not too obtrusive when worn but the Velcro portion has an annoying habit of breaking loose with the Pulse  band assembly later found in the morning on the floor or lost in the sheets  This did not happen with every use but at least once a week  If it still tracked my sleep I dont know perhaps not as accurately if still in the bed beside me  I have since misplaced the wrist band so I stopped tracking my sleep with the Pulse eventually I will get off my lazy rear and look for itThe silicone rubber beltpocket clip was easy to attach to fabric but not so easy to apply to my admittedly thick about 5mm belt  After only a few uses the silicone rubber portion quickly developed a tear at the clip I would assume from my thick belt  The clip continued to hold the Pulse but not very reliably  The Pulse started to develop an annoying habit of popping out of the holder when bending over  After several weeks of use the clip is now useless with the Pulse constantly falling out of the silicone holder  Lucky for me I have either heard or felt it pop out and drop to the floor but it is only a matter of time before it falls into something not easily retrieved  As a result I check to make sure it is attached several times a day and have now stopped using it regularly rendering the Pulse useless  Hopefully Withings will offer a little beefier clip and wrist band in the future so that I can put it to useIn walking I find the pedometer portion suspect  It appears too sensitive to movement  I initially had it attached to my pants pocket but kept seeing it read what I believe were outrageously high step counts  I noticed this when removing the device and placing it on my desk  I would check it before placing it down to give it time to catch up as there is a bit a of lag evident in the readout and after it sat on the desk for several minutes minimum  Then the display would increase the step count anywhere from a few steps to 2030 steps approximately  Assuming it was overly sensitive I switched from pocket to belt mounting but I am still not sure of the step count accuracy  I also noticed that when I was lazy and took the elevator it would show an elevation change which I assumed it would not do unless I was actively walking  I tend to fidget even when in an elevator and combined with the apparently sensitive nature of the Pulse it leads me to believe this is causing it to record this as steps  Just a guess however  I could continue to use it as is and just assume the readings will remain relative to the amount of actual activity but the lack of clip noted above makes this mootSo like I started saying I wanted to like the Pulse  But given the above I am not sure if my unit is just wonky or maybe my gait is too fast for the Pulse I walk very fast so fast that I am hardly ever passed by other walkers  Until I find a new improved belt clip it remains useless  Purchasing a different belt for this is just not an option and wasteful  I considered placing the Pulse in my pocket but worry it will end up in the wash I usually check my pockets but know it happens  The wrist strap is OK although I still have not found it for several weeks now so even my sleep cannot be tracked  I just cannot recommend it at this timeI am amending the review to note that the silicone beltpants clip has completely failed at this point purchased in November 2013 and it is now January 2014  Two months of use makes the
